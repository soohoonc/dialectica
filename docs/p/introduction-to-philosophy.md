# Introduction to Western Philosophy

Philosophy—from the Greek *philosophia*, "love of wisdom"—is the systematic study of fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. This page provides an overview of the Western philosophical tradition.

## Origins in [[classical-greece]]

Western philosophy began in ancient Greece in the 6th century BCE. The Pre-Socratic philosophers first sought natural explanations for phenomena previously attributed to the gods.

### The Athenian Tradition

[[athens]] became the philosophical center of the ancient world, home to the three foundational figures of Western thought:

1. **Socrates** (470-399 BCE): Developed the dialectical method of inquiry
2. [[plato]] (c. 428-348 BCE): Founded the Academy, developed the [[forms|Theory of Forms]]
3. [[aristotle]] (384-322 BCE): Systematized logic, developed [[virtue-ethics]]

## Major Branches

### Metaphysics

The study of the fundamental nature of reality. Key questions include:
- What exists?
- What is the nature of being?
- Do abstract objects exist? (see [[forms]])

### Epistemology

The study of knowledge. Key questions include:
- What can we know?
- What justifies belief?
- What are the limits of reason?

### Ethics

The study of right action and the good life. Major frameworks include:
- [[virtue-ethics]] (Aristotle)
- [[deontology]] (Kant)
- Consequentialism

### Logic

The study of valid reasoning, systematized by [[aristotle]] and developed through the medieval and modern periods.

## Historical Periods

1. **[[classical-greece|Ancient Philosophy]]** (6th c. BCE - 5th c. CE)
2. **Medieval Philosophy** (5th - 15th c.)
3. **Modern Philosophy** (17th - 19th c.), including the [[enlightenment]]
4. **Contemporary Philosophy** (20th c. - present)

## Why Study Philosophy?

Philosophy develops:
- Critical thinking and argumentation skills
- Ability to analyze complex problems
- Understanding of intellectual history
- Capacity for ethical reasoning
- Wonder at fundamental questions

As Socrates said: "The unexamined life is not worth living."
