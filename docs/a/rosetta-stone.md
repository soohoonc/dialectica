# Rosetta Stone

The Rosetta Stone is a granodiorite stele inscribed with a decree issued in Memphis, Egypt, in 196 BCE.

## Significance

The stone provided the key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphics, as it contains the same text in three scripts: Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, Demotic script, and Ancient Greek.

## Discovery

Discovered in 1799 by French soldiers during Napoleon's Egyptian campaign, the stone is now housed in the British Museum.

## Content

The decree was issued on behalf of King Ptolemy V, affirming the royal cult of the 13-year-old ruler.
