# The Night Watch

*The Night Watch* (Dutch: *De Nachtwacht*) is a 1642 painting by Rembrandt van Rijn, one of the most famous Dutch Golden Age paintings.

## Description

The large painting (11.91 ft × 14.34 ft) depicts a city guard moving out, led by Captain Frans Banninck Cocq and his lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch.

## Artistic Innovation

- Revolutionary use of light and shadow
- Dynamic composition suggesting movement
- Individual characterization of militia members
- Dramatic contrast with static traditional group portraits

## Title Misconception

The painting was called "The Night Watch" due to its darkened varnish; it actually depicts a daytime scene.

## Location

Housed in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, it is the museum's most famous piece and the centerpiece of its Gallery of Honour.
