# Critique of Pure Reason

The *Critique of Pure Reason* (German: *Kritik der reinen Vernunft*) is [[kant]]'s magnum opus, first published in 1781.

## Content

Kant investigates the limits and possibilities of human knowledge, arguing that while all knowledge begins with experience, it does not all arise from experience.

## Key Concepts

- **A priori / A posteriori**: Knowledge independent of or derived from experience
- **Analytic / Synthetic**: Judgments that are true by definition vs. those that add new information
- **Transcendental Idealism**: The view that space and time are forms of human intuition
- **The Categories**: Fundamental concepts the mind uses to structure experience
