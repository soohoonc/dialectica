# Being and Time

*Being and Time* (German: *Sein und Zeit*) is the 1927 magnum opus of Martin Heidegger.

## Content

Heidegger investigates the meaning of Being through an analysis of human existence (Dasein). The work fundamentally reshaped 20th-century philosophy.

## Key Concepts

- **Dasein**: Human being as "being-there"
- **Being-in-the-world**: The fundamental structure of existence
- **Thrownness**: Being thrown into existence without choice
- **Authenticity vs. Inauthenticity**: Living genuinely vs. conformity
- **Being-toward-death**: Mortality as defining human existence
