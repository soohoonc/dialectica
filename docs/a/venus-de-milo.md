# Venus de Milo

The *Venus de Milo* (Greek: Ἀφροδίτη τῆς Μήλου) is an ancient Greek sculpture created sometime between 150 and 125 BCE.

## Description

The marble statue depicts Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty. Standing approximately 6 feet 8 inches tall, the figure is notable for its missing arms and graceful contrapposto pose.

## Discovery

Discovered in 1820 on the island of Milos (Melos), the statue was acquired by France and is now displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris.

## Artistic Significance

The Venus de Milo exemplifies the Hellenistic period's blend of classical idealism with more naturalistic, emotional expression.
