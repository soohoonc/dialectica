# Benin Bronzes

The Benin Bronzes are a group of thousands of metal plaques and sculptures that decorated the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin (in present-day Nigeria).

## Description

Created from the 13th century onwards, the collection includes:
- Commemorative heads of kings (Obas) and queen mothers
- Relief plaques depicting court life and ceremonies
- Figures of warriors, musicians, and Portuguese traders
- Ceremonial objects and regalia

## Technique

Despite being called "bronzes," many pieces are made of brass, created using the lost-wax casting technique with remarkable sophistication.

## Colonial Looting

The majority of the bronzes were looted by British forces during the punitive expedition of 1897. They were subsequently sold to museums and collectors worldwide.

## Repatriation

In recent years, many institutions have begun returning Benin Bronzes to Nigeria, acknowledging their violent acquisition and cultural significance.
