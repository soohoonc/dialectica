# Leviathan

*Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil* is Thomas Hobbes's masterwork of political philosophy, published in 1651.

## Content

Hobbes argues for a powerful sovereign authority to prevent the "war of all against all" that would occur in the state of nature.

## Key Concepts

- **State of Nature**: Life without government is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"
- **Social Contract**: People surrender freedoms to a sovereign for protection
- **Absolute Sovereignty**: The sovereign must have unlimited power to maintain peace
- **Materialist Psychology**: Human actions driven by desires and aversions
