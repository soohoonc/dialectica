# An Essay Concerning Human Understanding

John Locke's *Essay* (1689) is a foundational work of empiricist philosophy.

## Content

Locke argues that the mind at birth is a "tabula rasa" (blank slate) and that all knowledge comes from experience.

## Key Concepts

- **Tabula Rasa**: The mind has no innate ideas
- **Simple and Complex Ideas**: Complex ideas built from simple sensory impressions
- **Primary and Secondary Qualities**: Intrinsic properties vs. perception-dependent properties
- **Personal Identity**: Continuity of consciousness defines the self
