# Parthenon Marbles

The Parthenon Marbles (also known as the Elgin Marbles) are classical Greek marble sculptures that were originally part of the Parthenon temple on the Acropolis of [[athens]].

## Description

The collection includes sculptures from the pediments, metopes depicting battles between Greeks and centaurs, and a large section of the frieze showing the Panathenaic procession.

## History

Created under the supervision of the sculptor Phidias, the marbles were removed from the Parthenon by Lord Elgin between 1801 and 1812. They are now housed in the British Museum.

## Controversy

Greece has long requested the return of the marbles, arguing they were taken without proper authorization and belong with the Parthenon.
