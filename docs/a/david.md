# David

*David* is a masterpiece of Renaissance sculpture created by Michelangelo Buonarroti between 1501 and 1504.

## Description

The 17-foot marble statue depicts the Biblical hero David in the moment before his battle with Goliath. Unlike earlier representations showing David victorious, Michelangelo captures the tension before combat.

## Artistic Features

- Idealized male form inspired by classical antiquity
- Exaggerated proportions (large head and hands) for viewing from below
- Intense concentration visible in the eyes and brow
- Contrapposto stance showing relaxed yet alert posture

## Location

Originally placed in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, the original is now housed in the Galleria dell'Accademia.

## Significance

The statue became a symbol of the Florentine Republic's strength and independence, and remains one of the most recognized works of art in history.
