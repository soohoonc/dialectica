# Aztec Sun Stone

The Aztec Sun Stone (Spanish: *Piedra del Sol*) is a large monolithic sculpture created during the reign of the Aztec emperor Axayacatl.

## Description

The circular basalt stone measures about 12 feet in diameter and weighs approximately 24 tons. It depicts the sun god Tonatiuh at the center, surrounded by symbols representing the five eras of Aztec cosmology.

## Symbolism

- **Center**: The face of Tonatiuh or the earth monster Tlaltecuhtli
- **Four squares**: Previous four suns/eras that were destroyed
- **Ring of day signs**: The 20 days of the Aztec calendar month
- **Outer rings**: Solar rays and fire serpents

## Discovery

Rediscovered in 1790 during renovations in Mexico City's main plaza, it is now housed in the National Museum of Anthropology.

## Misconception

Often called the "Aztec Calendar," the stone is actually a ceremonial monument rather than a functional calendar.
