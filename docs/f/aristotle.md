# Aristotle

Aristotle (384-322 BCE) was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece. Taught by [[plato]], he was the founder of the Peripatetic school of philosophy within the Lyceum and the wider Aristotelian tradition.

## Life

Born in Stagira, Aristotle moved to [[athens]] at age seventeen to study at Plato's Academy. He remained there for about twenty years until Plato's death in 347 BCE. He then traveled and eventually became the tutor of Alexander the Great.

## Philosophy

Aristotle's writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics, economics, politics, psychology, and aesthetics. His most notable philosophical contributions include:

- **Logic**: Aristotle is often credited as the "father of logic" for his work on syllogistic reasoning
- **Metaphysics**: His inquiry into "being qua being"
- **Ethics**: [[virtue-ethics]] as developed in the Nicomachean Ethics
- **Politics**: Analysis of political systems and the ideal state
- **Natural Philosophy**: Studies of physics, biology, and cosmology

## Influence

Aristotle's thought profoundly shaped medieval scholarship, both Islamic and Christian. His influence extends through [[thomism]] and into modern analytic philosophy.

## Works

Key works include:
- [[the-republic|Nicomachean Ethics]]
- Politics
- Metaphysics
