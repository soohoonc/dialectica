# Plato

Plato (c. 428-348 BCE) was an Athenian philosopher during the Classical period in Ancient Greece. Founder of the Academy in [[athens]], he is widely considered a pivotal figure in the history of Ancient Greek and Western philosophy.

## Life

Plato was born in Athens to an aristocratic family. He became a student of Socrates and was profoundly affected by his teacher's trial and execution. After Socrates' death, Plato traveled extensively before returning to Athens to found the Academy around 387 BCE.

## Philosophy

### Theory of Forms

Central to Plato's philosophy is the [[forms|Theory of Forms]], which posits that non-material abstract forms represent the most accurate reality. The physical world is merely an imperfect shadow of these eternal Forms.

### Epistemology

Plato distinguished between knowledge (episteme) and mere opinion (doxa). True knowledge is possible only of the Forms, while the sensory world yields only belief.

### Political Philosophy

In *The Republic*, Plato outlines his vision of an ideal state ruled by philosopher-kings, exploring justice both in the individual soul and in the city-state.

## Influence

Plato's philosophy influenced countless thinkers, including his student [[aristotle]], the Neoplatonists, Christian theologians, and modern philosophers. Alfred North Whitehead famously characterized Western philosophy as "a series of footnotes to Plato."

## Dialogues

Major works include:
- The Republic
- Symposium
- Phaedo
- Phaedrus
- Timaeus
