# Immanuel Kant

Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was a German philosopher and one of the central figures of modern philosophy. Kant's comprehensive and systematic works in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics have made him an influential figure in Western philosophy.

## Life

Kant spent his entire life in and around [[konigsberg]], East Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). He worked as a private tutor before becoming a professor at the University of Konigsberg, where he taught logic and metaphysics.

## Critical Philosophy

### Critique of Pure Reason (1781)

Kant's magnum opus argues that while all our knowledge begins with experience, it does not all arise from experience. He introduced the distinction between *a priori* and *a posteriori* knowledge, and between *analytic* and *synthetic* judgments.

### The Categorical Imperative

Central to Kant's ethical theory is the [[categorical-imperative]], formulated as: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

### Copernican Revolution

Kant's philosophical revolution suggested that objects must conform to our knowledge, rather than knowledge conforming to objects—a fundamental shift in epistemology.

## Influence

Kant's critical philosophy synthesized rationalist and empiricist traditions, profoundly influencing German Idealism, phenomenology, and analytic philosophy. His work on ethics established [[deontology]] as a major ethical framework opposing [[virtue-ethics]] and consequentialism.
