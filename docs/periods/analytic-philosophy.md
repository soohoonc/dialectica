## Context

Analytic philosophy emerged in reaction against 19th-century idealism, emphasizing precision, clarity, and scientific rigor. The development of mathematical logic by Frege, Russell, and others provided new tools for philosophical analysis.

The tradition flourished in the English-speaking world, particularly at Cambridge, Oxford, and American universities. Two World Wars led to significant migration of European philosophers to the United States, establishing analytic philosophy's dominance in Anglo-American academia.

## Legacy

Analytic philosophy established the methodology and institutional structure of contemporary academic philosophy:

- **Methodological Innovation**: Emphasis on argument, precision, and conceptual analysis
- **Logic and Language**: Revolutionary developments in formal logic and philosophy of language
- **Philosophy of Science**: Sophisticated analysis of scientific method and scientific knowledge
- **Applied Philosophy**: Development of bioethics, environmental ethics, and practical ethics
- **Global Influence**: Spread of analytic methods and standards worldwide

The tradition's commitment to clarity, argument, and systematic analysis continues to define academic philosophical practice, while its techniques have been applied to virtually every philosophical problem, creating increasingly specialized subdisciplines within philosophy.
