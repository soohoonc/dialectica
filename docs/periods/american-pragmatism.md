## Context

American Pragmatism emerged during America's Gilded Age and Progressive Era, reflecting the nation's democratic ideals, scientific optimism, and practical orientation. The movement developed in response to post-Civil War social challenges and the need for philosophical approaches suited to American democratic culture.

Key influences included Darwin's evolutionary theory, the rise of experimental science, American democratic traditions, and the practical demands of rapid industrialization and social change. The movement flourished at Harvard, Columbia, and the University of Chicago.

## Legacy

Pragmatism profoundly influenced American thought and education:

- **Education**: Dewey's progressive education movement transformed American schooling
- **Psychology**: James's functionalist psychology influenced behaviorism and cognitive science
- **Social Philosophy**: Pragmatic emphasis on democracy and social reform influenced Progressive Era reforms
- **Philosophy of Science**: Influenced logical positivism and philosophy of science
- **Contemporary Revival**: Neo-pragmatists like Richard Rorty and Hilary Putnam revived pragmatist themes

The movement's emphasis on fallibilism, pluralism, and the social nature of inquiry continues to influence contemporary [[periods/analytic-philosophy|analytic philosophy]], while its democratic values and experimental approach remain relevant to contemporary social and political philosophy.
