## Context

Early Modern philosophy emerged during the Scientific Revolution, characterized by the rise of modern science, the decline of Aristotelian scholasticism, and the religious upheavals of the Reformation. The period saw the development of new mathematical and experimental methods that transformed understanding of nature.

Major historical events included the Thirty Years' War, the English Civil War, the Glorious Revolution, and the Enlightenment. Philosophers responded to skeptical challenges raised by religious conflict and the new science while seeking to establish secure foundations for knowledge and morality.

## Legacy

Early Modern philosophy established the framework for subsequent philosophical development:

- **[[periods/german-idealism|German Idealism]]**: Kant's critical philosophy directly inspired Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel
- **[[periods/analytic-philosophy|Analytic Philosophy]]**: Emphasis on clarity, logic, and analysis of language
- **Political Philosophy**: Social contract theory influenced modern democratic institutions
- **Epistemology**: The rationalism-empiricism debate shaped theories of knowledge
- **Ethics**: Kantian deontological ethics remains a major moral theory

The period's emphasis on systematic method, critical examination of assumptions, and the integration of reason with experience continues to define philosophical practice, while its political theories profoundly influenced the development of liberal democracy and human rights.
