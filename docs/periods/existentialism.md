## Context

Existentialism emerged from the crisis of traditional religious and philosophical certainties in 19th-century Europe, intensified by two World Wars, the Holocaust, and rapid social change. The movement responded to the apparent meaninglessness of modern life and the collapse of traditional value systems.

Key influences included the breakdown of Hegelian systematic philosophy, the critique of Christian orthodoxy, rapid industrialization, and the experience of alienation in modern society. The movement flourished particularly in France during and after World War II.

## Legacy

Existentialism profoundly influenced 20th-century culture and thought:

- **Literature and Arts**: Influenced writers like Kafka, Beckett, and filmmakers like Bergman
- **Psychology**: Contributed to humanistic and existential psychotherapy
- **[[periods/continental-philosophy|Continental Philosophy]]**: Provided foundation for phenomenology and poststructuralism
- **Feminist Philosophy**: Beauvoir's work launched second-wave feminism
- **Popular Culture**: Concepts of authenticity, freedom, and responsibility entered mainstream discourse

The movement's emphasis on individual responsibility, authentic existence, and the creation of meaning continues to influence contemporary discussions of personal identity, moral responsibility, and the human condition in an increasingly secular and complex world.
