## Context

Continental philosophy emerged from the crisis of European culture in the early 20th century, responding to two World Wars, the Holocaust, and the perceived failures of Enlightenment rationality. The tradition developed primarily in Germany and France, though it later spread throughout Europe and beyond.

Key historical influences included the phenomenological movement, existentialism's response to absurdity and alienation, the Frankfurt School's critique of instrumental reason, and French poststructuralism's challenge to traditional metaphysics.

## Legacy

Continental philosophy has profoundly influenced humanities and social sciences:

- **Literary Theory**: Hermeneutics and deconstruction revolutionized textual interpretation
- **Social Theory**: Critical theory and genealogy informed sociological analysis
- **Psychology**: Phenomenology and existentialism influenced humanistic psychology
- **Political Theory**: Critiques of power, ideology, and modernity shaped contemporary politics
- **Gender Studies**: Feminist philosophy drew extensively on continental resources

The tradition's emphasis on historicity, embodiment, language, and power continues to provide alternatives to purely analytical approaches, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and cultural critique.
