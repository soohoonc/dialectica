## Context

Neo-Confucianism emerged during the Song Dynasty (960-1279) as Confucian scholars responded to the intellectual challenges posed by Buddhism and Daoism. The period saw remarkable economic prosperity, technological innovation, and cultural flourishing that created conditions for philosophical synthesis.

The movement developed within the context of civil service examinations based on Confucian texts, creating institutional support for systematic philosophical education. The Mongol Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368) and Chinese Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) adopted Neo-Confucian philosophy as state orthodoxy.

## Legacy

Neo-Confucianism profoundly shaped East Asian intellectual culture:

- **Political Philosophy**: Influenced governmental systems throughout East Asia for centuries
- **Educational Systems**: Established curriculum and pedagogical methods still influential today
- **[[periods/japanese-philosophy|Japanese Philosophy]]**: Adapted by Japanese scholars, influencing bushido and modern thought
- **Korean Philosophy**: Became dominant intellectual tradition in Korea
- **Modern Revival**: Contemporary scholars draw on Neo-Confucian resources for virtue ethics and social philosophy

The tradition's integration of metaphysics, ethics, and spiritual practice continues to offer systematic approaches to moral cultivation, social harmony, and the relationship between individual and cosmic order, providing alternatives to purely individualistic Western philosophy.
