# Pre-Socratic Philosophy

**Time Period**: 600 BCE - 400 BCE

## Overview

The earliest Western philosophers who sought natural explanations for the cosmos and established fundamental concepts of rational inquiry

## Key Ideas

### [[individuals/heraclitus|Heraclitus]]

- **Logos and Flux**: The doctrine that all things are in constant flux, yet unified by an underlying rational principle (logos)
  - Tags: #Metaphysics, #Cosmology

### [[individuals/parmenides|Parmenides]]

- **Being and Non-Being**: The philosophical distinction between what exists (Being) and what does not exist (Non-Being), establishing the foundation for ontology
  - Tags: #Metaphysics, #Ontology

### [[individuals/democritus|Democritus]]

- **Atomism**: The theory that all matter consists of indivisible atoms moving in void space
  - Tags: #Physics, #Metaphysics

## Intellectual Networks

This period laid the groundwork for all subsequent Western philosophy, establishing key questions about the nature of reality, change, and knowledge.

### Most Influential Ideas

- The concept of logos (universal reason) by [[individuals/heraclitus|Heraclitus]]
- The principle of non-contradiction by [[individuals/parmenides|Parmenides]]
- Atomic theory by [[individuals/democritus|Democritus]]

## Timeline

- **c. 585 BCE**: Thales predicts solar eclipse, traditionally marking the beginning of Western philosophy
- **c. 560-546 BCE**: Anaximander develops cosmological theories about the infinite (apeiron)
- **c. 535-475 BCE**: [[individuals/heraclitus|Heraclitus]] teaches about logos and the unity of opposites
- **c. 515-445 BCE**: [[individuals/parmenides|Parmenides]] establishes logical principles and the Way of Truth
- **c. 490-430 BCE**: Zeno of Elea formulates paradoxes supporting Parmenidean philosophy
- **c. 460-370 BCE**: [[individuals/democritus|Democritus]] develops atomic theory with Leucippus

## Context

The Pre-Socratic period emerged during the Greek Archaic period, characterized by the rise of city-states (poleis) and increased contact with Eastern civilizations through trade. This era saw the transition from mythological explanations of natural phenomena to rational, philosophical inquiry. The Ionian Greeks, living on the Asia Minor coast, were particularly influenced by Babylonian and Egyptian knowledge while developing distinctively Greek approaches to understanding nature (physis).

The period coincided with significant political and cultural developments including the establishment of democracy in Athens, the Persian Wars, and the flourishing of Greek colonies throughout the Mediterranean.

## Legacy

Pre-Socratic philosophy established the fundamental framework for Western philosophical inquiry:

- **Methodological Innovation**: Introduced rational argumentation and logical analysis as tools for understanding reality
- **Metaphysical Foundations**: Established key concepts like substance, change, causation, and the one/many problem
- **Influence on [[periods/ancient-philosophy|Ancient Philosophy]]**: Directly influenced [[individuals/socrates|Socrates]], [[individuals/plato|Plato]], and [[individuals/aristotle|Aristotle]]
- **Scientific Legacy**: Atomic theory and natural philosophy laid groundwork for later scientific development
- **Logical Principles**: Parmenidean logic influenced the development of formal reasoning systems

This period's emphasis on finding natural rather than supernatural explanations for phenomena established the rational spirit that would characterize Western philosophy and science for millennia.
