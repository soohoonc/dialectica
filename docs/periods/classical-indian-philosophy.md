## Context

Classical Indian philosophy developed within a culture emphasizing spiritual liberation and the systematic exploration of consciousness. The tradition evolved through oral transmission, eventually producing written texts that engaged in sophisticated philosophical argumentation.

The period was characterized by the interaction between Vedic Brahmanical traditions and heterodox movements like Buddhism and Jainism. This intellectual ferment produced diverse philosophical schools that debated fundamental questions about reality, knowledge, and the path to liberation.

## Legacy

Classical Indian philosophy profoundly influenced world thought:

- **Buddhist Philosophy**: Spread throughout Asia, adapting to different cultural contexts
- **Hindu Renaissance**: 19th-century revival drew on classical sources
- **Western Interest**: Influenced transcendentalists, theosophists, and contemporary philosophers
- **Comparative Philosophy**: Provided alternative approaches to fundamental philosophical problems
- **Spiritual Practice**: Integration of philosophy with meditation and yogic practices

The tradition's emphasis on the systematic exploration of consciousness, the integration of theory and practice, and the goal of liberation continues to offer valuable insights for contemporary philosophy of mind, ethics, and spiritual inquiry.
