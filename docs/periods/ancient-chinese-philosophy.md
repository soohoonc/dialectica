## Context

Ancient Chinese philosophy developed during the Eastern Zhou period, particularly the Spring and Autumn (770-476 BCE) and Warring States (475-221 BCE) periods. Political fragmentation led to intellectual flourishing as different schools competed for influence among rival states.

The period was characterized by social upheaval, technological advancement, and the breakdown of traditional feudal structures. Philosophers sought to address questions of good government, moral cultivation, and the relationship between humanity and nature.

## Legacy

Ancient Chinese philosophy established enduring traditions that continue to influence East Asian culture:

- **[[periods/neo-confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]]**: Medieval synthesis of Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist elements
- **Political Philosophy**: Confucian ideals influenced Chinese imperial government for two millennia
- **East Asian Buddhism**: Chinese philosophical concepts shaped Buddhist development
- **Modern Revival**: 20th-century Chinese philosophers drew on classical resources
- **Contemporary Relevance**: Ancient insights inform modern discussions of virtue ethics, environmental philosophy, and political theory

The period's emphasis on harmony, virtue cultivation, and the integration of personal and social development continues to offer alternatives to purely individualistic Western approaches, while its sophisticated analysis of human nature, knowledge, and governance remains philosophically significant.
