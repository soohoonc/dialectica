## Context

The Hellenistic period began with the death of Alexander the Great and the fragmentation of his empire. This political upheaval created a sense of individual vulnerability and uncertainty, leading philosophers to focus on personal ethics and achieving happiness (eudaimonia) through philosophical practice.

The period was characterized by the spread of Greek culture throughout the Mediterranean and Near East, the rise of Rome as a dominant power, and the eventual emergence of Christianity. Philosophical schools became more like religious communities, offering complete ways of life rather than just theoretical systems.

## Legacy

Hellenistic philosophy profoundly influenced later Western thought:

- **Roman Philosophy**: Adapted by figures like Cicero, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius
- **Christian Philosophy**: Stoic ethics and Platonic metaphysics influenced early [[periods/patristic-philosophy|Patristic Philosophy]]
- **Modern Revival**: Stoicism and Epicureanism resurged during the Renaissance and Enlightenment
- **Therapeutic Philosophy**: Established philosophy as a form of spiritual therapy
- **Influence on [[periods/medieval-philosophy|Medieval Philosophy]]**: Transmitted classical learning to Islamic and Christian thinkers

The period's emphasis on practical wisdom and ethical living continues to influence contemporary philosophical counseling and virtue ethics, while its integration of physics, logic, and ethics provided a model for systematic philosophy.
