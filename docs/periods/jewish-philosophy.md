## Context

Jewish philosophy emerged from the encounter between Jewish religious tradition and Greek philosophical culture in Hellenistic Alexandria. The tradition continued through the Islamic period, Christian medieval period, and into the modern era as Jewish thinkers engaged with successive philosophical developments.

Major historical influences included the destruction of the Temple (70 CE), medieval Jewish life in Islamic and Christian contexts, emancipation and enlightenment, the Holocaust, and the establishment of Israel. Each period required new philosophical responses to changed circumstances while maintaining continuity with Jewish tradition.

## Legacy

Jewish philosophy has contributed significantly to world thought:

- **Medieval Philosophy**: Maimonides influenced both Islamic and Christian philosophy, particularly Thomas Aquinas
- **Modern Philosophy**: Jewish philosophers like Spinoza, Cohen, and Rosenzweig shaped modern philosophical development
- **[[periods/continental-philosophy|Continental Philosophy]]**: Jewish thinkers like Levinas, Derrida, and Jonas influenced contemporary philosophy
- **Ethics**: Jewish emphasis on ethical monotheism and social justice influenced moral philosophy
- **Religious Philosophy**: Provided models for integrating philosophical reasoning with religious commitment

The tradition's emphasis on ethical responsibility, textual interpretation, and the integration of particular religious identity with universal philosophical inquiry continues to influence contemporary discussions of religious philosophy, ethics, and hermeneutics.
