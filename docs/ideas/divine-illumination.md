# Divine Illumination

**Author**: [[individuals/augustine|Augustine]]

**Year**: 400

**Historical Period**: [[periods/patristic-philosophy|Patristic Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Epistemology, #Theology

## Description

The epistemological doctrine that human knowledge of eternal truths (mathematical, logical, moral) requires direct illumination from God. The human mind cannot achieve certain knowledge through natural reason alone but needs divine assistance.

## Influenced By

- **builds_upon**: [[ideas/theory-of-forms|Theory of Forms]] by [[individuals/plato|Plato]] - Augustine Christianized Plato's eternal Forms as thoughts in God's mind
- **responds_to**: Academic skepticism's challenge to certain knowledge
- **builds_upon**: Christian Neoplatonism, especially [[individuals/plotinus|Plotinus]]'s theory of emanation

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/anselm-of-canterbury|Anselm]]'s ontological argument - God as that than which nothing greater can be conceived
- **influences**: [[individuals/thomas-aquinas|Aquinas]]'s theory of knowledge - Though Aquinas ultimately rejected illumination for abstraction
- **influences**: [[individuals/duns-scotus|Scotus]]'s voluntarism - Divine will as source of truth and value
- **influences**: [[individuals/nicolas-malebranche|Malebranche]]'s occasionalism - "We see all things in God"
- **influences**: [[ideas/substance-monism|Substance Monism]] by [[individuals/spinoza|Spinoza]] - All knowledge as participation in God's infinite intellect
- **criticized_by**: [[individuals/william-of-ockham|Ockham]] and later nominalists who emphasized natural reason

## Notes

Augustine developed divine illumination in works like *De Magistro* (The Teacher) and *De Trinitate*. Key elements include:

**The Problem**: How can finite, mutable minds grasp eternal, immutable truths? Mathematical truths like 2+2=4 are:
- Universal (true for all minds)
- Necessary (cannot be otherwise)  
- Eternal (not dependent on time)
- Immutable (unchanging)

**The Solution**: Such truths require divine illumination because:
- Human minds are created, finite, and changeable
- Immutable truth cannot arise from mutable sources
- God's eternal light illuminates the mind when it contemplates eternal truths
- This is not new knowledge but recognition of what God reveals

**Mechanism**: Augustine compared divine illumination to physical sight:
- Eyes need light to see physical objects
- Mind needs divine light to "see" eternal truths
- God is the "light of the mind" as sun is light of the eyes

**Implications**: 
- All human knowledge ultimately depends on God
- Skepticism is impossible because God guarantees truth
- Philosophy and theology are intimately connected

Medieval debates centered on whether illumination is:
- Special (miraculous intervention) or general (natural providence)
- Direct (God immediately causes knowledge) or indirect (God creates mind's capacity)
- Ontological (God's ideas as objects of knowledge) or epistemological (God's help in knowing)

Modern philosophers generally reject divine illumination as unnecessary given natural explanations of a priori knowledge, though some Christian philosophers like [[individuals/alvin-plantinga|Plantinga]] defend Reformed epistemology with similar themes.
