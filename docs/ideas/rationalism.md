# Rationalism

**Author**: [[individuals/descartes|Descartes]]

**Year**: 1637

**Historical Period**: [[periods/early-modern-philosophy|Early Modern Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Epistemology, #Metaphysics

## Description

The epistemological doctrine that reason is the primary source of knowledge and that significant knowledge can be gained independently of sensory experience through rational intuition and deduction from innate ideas.

## Influenced By

- **builds_upon**: [[ideas/divine-illumination|Divine Illumination]] by [[individuals/augustine|Augustine]] - Rational insight as divine gift
- **builds_upon**: Mathematical method and its certainty as model for all knowledge
- **responds_to**: Scholastic reliance on authority and tradition
- **influenced_by**: Platonic tradition emphasizing reason over sensation

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/spinoza|Spinoza]]'s geometric method in [[ideas/substance-monism|Substance Monism]]
- **influences**: [[individuals/gottfried-leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[ideas/monadology|Monadology]] and principle of sufficient reason
- **influences**: German Idealism, especially [[individuals/georg-wilhelm-friedrich-hegel|Hegel]]'s absolute idealism
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/empiricism|Empiricism]] by [[individuals/john-locke|Locke]], [[individuals/david-hume|Hume]]
- **synthesized_with**: [[individuals/immanuel-kant|Kant]]'s critical philosophy combining reason and experience

## Notes

**Cartesian Rationalism:**

**Method of Doubt**: [[ideas/methodological-doubt|Methodological Doubt]]
- Doubt everything possible to find indubitable foundation
- Sensory experience unreliable (dreams, illusions, evil demon)
- Mathematical truths seem certain but might be deceiving

**Cogito Ergo Sum**: "I think, therefore I am"
- Cannot doubt that I exist while doubting
- Provides indubitable foundation for knowledge
- Self-evident rational intuition, not empirical observation

**Innate Ideas**:
- Mind possesses ideas not derived from experience (God, infinity, perfection)
- Clear and distinct perceptions mark truth
- Mathematical concepts and logical principles innate

**Continental Rationalism:**

**Spinoza's Geometric Method**:
- Ethics demonstrated in geometrical order
- Rational necessity governs all existence
- Adequate ideas provide true knowledge of reality's structure

**Leibniz's Logical Rationalism**:
- Principle of sufficient reason: Nothing without reason
- All truths either analytic (logic/mathematics) or grounded in sufficient reason
- Possible worlds and modal metaphysics developed through reason

**Arguments For Rationalism**:
1. **Mathematical Knowledge**: Geometry and arithmetic seem independent of experience
2. **Logical Principles**: Laws of logic not learned from observation
3. **Metaphysical Truths**: Necessary truths about existence, causation, identity
4. **Poverty of Stimulus**: Children learn complex languages from limited input
5. **Universality**: Basic rational principles universal across cultures

**Arguments Against**:
1. **Empirical Basis**: Even mathematics might derive from spatial experience
2. **Cultural Variation**: Logical and metaphysical intuitions vary across cultures
3. **Evolutionary Explanation**: "Innate" ideas might be evolved cognitive dispositions
4. **Fallibility**: History shows rational intuitions often mistaken
5. **Circularity**: Using reason to validate reason potentially circular

**Contemporary Developments**:
- **Chomskyan Linguistics**: Universal grammar as innate rational structure
- **Evolutionary Psychology**: Cognitive modules as rational endowments  
- **Mathematical Platonism**: Mathematical objects as rational objects of intuition
- **Conceptual Analysis**: A priori knowledge through concept examination

**Kant's Critical Synthesis**:
- Synthetic a priori knowledge: Rational forms applied to sensory content
- Categories structure experience but don't give knowledge of things-in-themselves
- Pure reason has limits; practical reason governs moral knowledge
- Transcendental idealism: Space/time as rational forms, not things-in-themselves
