# Occasionalism

**Author**: [[individuals/nicolas-malebranche|Malebranche]]

**Year**: 1674

**Historical Period**: [[periods/early-modern-philosophy|Early Modern Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Metaphysics, #Philosophy of Mind

## Description

The doctrine that finite substances (minds and bodies) have no genuine causal power; only God is a true cause. Natural events and mental states are "occasions" for God's direct intervention, creating the appearance of causal interaction.

## Influenced By

- **responds_to**: [[ideas/cogito-ergo-sum|Cogito Ergo Sum]] by [[individuals/descartes|Descartes]] - Occasionalism solves the mind-body interaction problem in Cartesian dualism
- **builds_upon**: [[ideas/divine-illumination|Divine Illumination]] by [[individuals/augustine|Augustine]] - Extended Augustine's divine dependence from knowledge to causation
- **influenced_by**: Cartesian mechanistic physics - If bodies are mere extension, they cannot be genuine causes

## Influences

- **influences**: [[ideas/monadology|Monadology]] by [[individuals/gottfried-leibniz|Leibniz]] - Leibniz adopted the no-interaction thesis but replaced occasionalism with pre-established harmony
- **influences**: [[ideas/immaterialism|Immaterialism]] by [[individuals/george-berkeley|Berkeley]] - Berkeley used similar arguments about divine causation
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/substance-monism|Substance Monism]] by [[individuals/spinoza|Spinoza]] - Spinoza rejected occasionalism by making God the only substance
- **criticized_by**: [[individuals/david-hume|Hume]]'s analysis of causation - Hume questioned whether we can know any causal connections, divine or natural

## Notes

Malebranche's *Search After Truth* develops occasionalism through several arguments:

**The Causal Argument:**
1. True causation requires necessary connection between cause and effect
2. Finite minds cannot see necessary connections in nature
3. Only God's will necessarily produces effects
4. Therefore, God is the only true cause

**The Mind-Body Problem:**
- Cartesian dualism makes mind-body interaction mysterious
- How can immaterial mind move material body?
- Solution: Mental volitions are occasions for God to move bodies
- Physical events are occasions for God to produce sensations

**Biblical Support:**
- "In Him we live and move and have our being" (Acts 17:28)
- God's continuous creation and providence
- Creatures have no independent existence or power

**Implications:**
- Natural laws describe God's regular volitions, not genuine causal powers
- Moral responsibility remains because our volitions are real occasions
- Miracles are simply God acting differently than usual
- Science studies patterns in divine action

**Criticisms:**
- Makes God responsible for evil (theodicy problem)
- Eliminates genuine natural powers
- Reduces creatures to mere phenomena
- Creates infinite regress (what causes God's volitions?)

Occasionalism influenced Islamic philosophy through [[individuals/al-ghazali|Al-Ghazali]]'s similar doctrine. Contemporary philosophers debate whether occasionalism provides resources for addressing current problems in philosophy of mind and causation, particularly regarding mental causation and the causal closure of physics.
