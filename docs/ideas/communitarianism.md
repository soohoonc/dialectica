# Communitarianism

## Core Concept
Communitarianism emphasizes the importance of community membership, shared values, and social bonds in human flourishing, criticizing liberal individualism and advocating for the priority of community goods over individual rights.

## Historical Development

### Philosophical Roots
- [[Aristotle]]'s *Politics* - humans as political animals requiring community
- [[G.W.F. Hegel]]'s *Philosophy of Right* - ethical life in family, civil society, state
- [[Edmund Burke]]'s organic society and tradition
- [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s analysis of American democracy and civic associations

### Modern Revival (1980s-1990s)

**Context: Liberal Theory Dominance**
The communitarian critique emerged in response to:
- [[John Rawls]]' *A Theory of Justice* and procedural liberalism
- Rights-based individualism in law and politics
- Decline of civic engagement and social solidarity
- Rise of identity politics and multiculturalism

### Leading Communitarian Thinkers

**Alasdair MacIntyre: After Virtue**
[[Alasdair MacIntyre]]'s *After Virtue* (1981) launched the communitarian critique:

**Diagnosis of Moral Crisis**
- **Emotivism**: modern moral discourse reduced to expressions of preference
- **Fragmentation**: loss of coherent moral framework
- **Bureaucratic individualism**: instrumental rationality dominates
- **Compartmentalization**: separation of roles and moral identity

**Virtue Ethics Revival**
- **Practices**: coherent, complex activities with internal goods
- **Narrative unity**: human life as quest for the good
- **Traditions**: historically extended arguments about goods
- **Community context**: virtues only intelligible within traditions

**Critique of Liberalism**
- **Unencumbered self**: liberal individuals too abstract
- **Procedural justice**: cannot be neutral between conceptions of good
- **Historical amnesia**: ignores social and cultural inheritance
- **Moral relativism**: inability to make substantive moral judgments

**Michael Sandel: The Encumbered Self**
[[Michael Sandel]]'s critique of Rawlsian liberalism:

**Constitutive vs. Voluntary Communities**
- **Constitutive attachments**: identity partly formed by community membership
- **Limits of choice**: cannot choose all aspects of identity
- **Thick vs. thin identity**: substantial vs. minimal conception of self
- **Moral psychology**: communal rather than individualistic foundations

**Critique of the Original Position**
- **[[Veil of Ignorance]]** strips away too much of moral personality
- **Unencumbered self**: impossible and undesirable conception of persons
- **Justice vs. good**: cannot separate right from conception of good life
- **Procedural republic**: inadequate for democratic citizenship

**Charles Taylor: Recognition and Authenticity**
[[Charles Taylor]]'s analysis of modern identity:

**Politics of Recognition**
- **Recognition**: fundamental human need for acknowledgment
- **Misrecognition**: oppression through distorted reflection of identity
- **Multiculturalism**: group rights and cultural survival
- **Dialogical self**: identity formed through interaction with significant others

**Critique of Atomism**
- **Social beings**: humans essentially social, not pre-social individuals
- **Language and culture**: irreducibly social phenomena
- **Common meanings**: shared understanding necessary for social life
- **Situated freedom**: liberty requires cultural and historical context

**Ethics of Authenticity**
- **Authenticity ideal**: being true to oneself as modern value
- **Individualism**: benefits and dangers of self-fulfillment ethic
- **Moral sources**: need for transcendent goods beyond individual choice
- **Community goods**: irreducibly social values and meanings

**Amitai Etzioni: Responsive Communitarianism**
[[Amitai Etzioni]]'s practical communitarian agenda:

**Rights and Responsibilities Balance**
- **Pendulum shift**: excessive individualism needs communitarian correction
- **Moral voice**: community moral suasion vs. legal coercion
- **Social order**: balance between autonomy and community
- **Civic virtues**: rebuilding social institutions

**New Golden Rule**: respect and uphold society's moral order as you would have society respect and uphold your autonomy

**Policy Applications**
- **Family values**: supporting marriage, parenting, care relationships
- **Civic education**: teaching responsibilities alongside rights
- **Community policing**: local involvement in public safety
- **Voluntary associations**: mediating institutions between individual and state

## Core Philosophical Themes

### Critique of Liberal Individualism

**The Unencumbered Self**
Communitarians argue liberalism assumes:
- **Pre-social individuals**: persons exist prior to social attachments
- **Voluntarist conception**: all commitments chosen rather than inherited
- **Thin identity**: minimal conception of personal identity
- **Procedural priority**: right over good, justice over virtue

**Social Constitution of Identity**
Communitarian alternative:
- **Embedded self**: identity partly constituted by community membership
- **Unchosen attachments**: family, nation, tradition shape who we are
- **Thick identity**: substantial conception including communal roles
- **Substantive good**: communities embody particular visions of flourishing

### Shared Values and Common Good

**Beyond Procedural Justice**
- **Substantive conceptions**: communities must affirm particular goods
- **Public philosophy**: shared understanding of citizenship and virtue
- **Moral education**: transmitting values across generations
- **Cultural reproduction**: maintaining meaningful traditions

**Community Goods**
- **Irreducibly social**: goods that exist only through shared participation
- **Examples**: friendship, patriotism, religious community, artistic traditions
- **Non-distributive**: cannot be divided among individuals
- **Constitutive**: partially define what it means to be human
