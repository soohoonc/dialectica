# Marxism

## Core Concept
Marxism is a comprehensive social, economic, and political theory developed by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] that analyzes capitalism through historical materialism, predicting its eventual replacement by socialism and communism through class struggle.

## Historical Development

### Intellectual Foundations

**German Idealism**
- [[G.W.F. Hegel]]'s dialectical method and historical development
- [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s materialist critique of religion
- **Dialectical materialism**: synthesis of Hegelian dialectics with materialism
- **Historical progression**: understanding society through contradictions and change

**Classical Political Economy**
- [[Adam Smith]]'s labor theory of value and market analysis
- [[David Ricardo]]'s development of labor theory and rent theory
- **Critique and development**: Marx's transformation of bourgeois economics
- **Scientific socialism**: distinguishing from utopian socialism

**French Socialism**
- [[Claude Henri de Saint-Simon]]'s industrial society analysis
- [[Charles Fourier]]'s critique of civilized society
- [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s property critique and mutualism
- **Revolutionary tradition**: French Revolution and worker movements

### Marx and Engels' Collaboration

**Early Works (1840s)**
- *The German Ideology* (1845): historical materialism foundations
- *The Communist Manifesto* (1848): popular exposition of theory
- *Theses on Feuerbach* (1845): \"philosophers have interpreted the world; the point is to change it\"

**Mature Economic Theory**
- *Capital* Volume I (1867): systematic analysis of capitalist production
- *Grundrisse* (1857-1858): notebooks on political economy
- Volumes II and III of *Capital*: circulation and process of capitalist production

**Key Theoretical Innovations**
- **Historical materialism**: material conditions determine social consciousness
- **Labor theory of value**: commodities' value determined by socially necessary labor time
- **Surplus value**: source of capitalist profit through unpaid labor
- **Class struggle**: engine of historical change

## Core Theoretical Framework

### Historical Materialism

**Base and Superstructure**
- **Economic base**: mode of production (forces and relations of production)
- **Superstructure**: politics, law, ideology, culture, religion
- **Determination**: economic base ultimately determines superstructure
- **Relative autonomy**: superstructure can influence base

**Modes of Production**
1. **Primitive communism**: classless, stateless, common ownership
2. **Slave society**: direct ownership of human beings
3. **Feudalism**: land-based hierarchy and personal dependence
4. **Capitalism**: wage labor and private ownership of means of production
5. **Socialism/Communism**: worker ownership and planned production

**Dialectical Development**
- **Thesis-antithesis-synthesis**: contradictions driving historical change
- **Forces vs. relations of production**: technological development vs. social organization
- **Revolution**: when contradictions become unbearable
- **Historical necessity**: capitalism contains seeds of its own destruction

### Economic Analysis of Capitalism

**Labor Theory of Value**
- **Use value**: utility of commodity for satisfying human needs
- **Exchange value**: quantitative relationship in which commodities trade
- **Labor value**: socially necessary labor time required for production
- **Abstract labor**: homogeneous human labor creating exchange value

**Surplus Value Theory**
- **Labor power**: worker's capacity to work sold as commodity
- **Necessary labor time**: time required to reproduce value of labor power
- **Surplus labor time**: additional time worker works beyond necessary labor
- **Rate of exploitation**: surplus value divided by variable capital

**Capital Accumulation**
- **Primitive accumulation**: original separation of workers from means of production
- **Expanded reproduction**: reinvestment of surplus value in more production
- **Organic composition**: ratio of constant capital (machinery) to variable capital (wages)
- **Tendency of rate of profit to fall**: increasing organic composition reduces profit rate

**Alienation**
- **From product**: workers don't own what they produce
- **From activity**: work becomes external, forced activity
- **From species-being**: human creative essence distorted by wage labor
- **From others**: competition and class division fragment social relations

### Class Analysis

**Class Structure in Capitalism**
- **Bourgeoisie**: owners of means of production
- **Proletariat**: workers who sell their labor power
- **Petty bourgeoisie**: small owners caught between main classes
- **Lumpenproletariat**: unemployed and underemployed masses

**Class Consciousness**
- **Class in itself**: objective economic position
- **Class for itself**: subjective awareness and political organization
- **False consciousness**: misunderstanding of class interests
- **Revolutionary consciousness**: understanding need for system change

**Class Struggle**
- **Economic struggle**: wages, hours, working conditions
- **Political struggle**: state power and legislation
- **Ideological struggle**: competing worldviews and values
- **Revolutionary struggle**: overthrow of capitalist system
