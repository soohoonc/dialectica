# Feminist Ethics

## Core Concept
Feminist ethics critiques traditional moral theories from gender-conscious perspectives, challenging male-dominated philosophical assumptions and developing alternative ethical frameworks that account for women's experiences, relationships, and values.

## Historical Development

### First Wave: Moral Equality Arguments
Early feminist ethics focused on arguing for women's moral equality and challenging exclusions from moral consideration.

**Mary Wollstonecraft's Foundation**
- *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman* (1792) argued for women's rational moral capacity
- Challenged Rousseau's claims about women's natural moral inferiority
- Established pattern of critiquing philosophical misogyny

**19th Century Developments**
- [[John Stuart Mill]] and Harriet Taylor's collaboration on women's rights
- Arguments that women's moral capacities equal men's when given equal opportunities
- Focus on extending existing moral and political frameworks to include women

### Second Wave: Structural Critique

**Simone de Beauvoir's Revolutionary Analysis**
[[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s *The Second Sex* (1949) transformed feminist ethical thinking:
- **"One is not born, but becomes, a woman"** - gender as social construction
- Analysis of women as the "Other" in relation to male-defined humanity
- **Bad faith** - how women internalize oppressive social roles
- Connection between existentialist ethics and feminist liberation
- Critique of women's reduction to biological functions

**Beauvoir's Ethical Framework**
- Authentic existence requires rejecting socially imposed limitations
- Ethics of liberation: creating conditions for women's genuine choice
- Analysis of how social structures constrain women's freedom
- Integration of [[existentialism]] with feminist analysis

### Third Wave: Intersectional and Diverse Approaches

**Judith Butler's Post-Structuralist Revolution**
[[Judith Butler]] radically reconceptualized gender and ethics:
- **Gender performativity**: gender as repeated performance rather than essence
- Critique of binary gender categories
- **Subversion through repetition**: ethical potential in parodic gender performances
- Challenge to fixed identity categories in ethics

**Butler's Ethical Contributions**
- *Precarious Life* - ethics of grievability and recognition
- *Giving an Account of Oneself* - narrative identity and ethical responsibility
- Influence of [[Emmanuel Levinas]] on ethics of the face-to-face encounter
- Post-sovereign conception of ethical subjectivity

### Contemporary Developments

**Martha Nussbaum's Capabilities Approach**
[[Martha Nussbaum]] develops feminist applications of capabilities theory:
- **Central capabilities**: what all humans need for flourishing life
- **Adaptive preferences**: how oppression distorts what people think they deserve
- Global application to women's rights and development
- Integration of Aristotelian virtue ethics with feminist concerns

**Capabilities and Women's Flourishing**
- Education, health, political participation as essential capabilities
- Critique of preference-based approaches that ignore background injustice
- Cross-cultural application while respecting diversity
- Policy applications in international development

## Major Theoretical Approaches

### Liberal Feminist Ethics
- Extension of rights and opportunities to women
- Emphasis on equality and individual autonomy
- Reform of existing institutions rather than revolutionary change
- Examples: [[John Stuart Mill]], early [[Betty Friedan]]

### Radical Feminist Ethics
- Fundamental critique of patriarchal structures
- Analysis of male domination as central organizing principle
- Emphasis on women's distinctive experiences and values
- Examples: [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Catharine MacKinnon]]

### Cultural Feminist Ethics
- Celebration of traditionally feminine values
- Development of ethics based on women's experiences
- Connection to [[Care Ethics]] and relational approaches
- Examples: [[Nel Noddings]], [[Sara Ruddick]]

### Postmodern/Post-structuralist Feminist Ethics
- Critique of unified gender categories
- Analysis of multiple, intersecting identities
- Emphasis on difference and plurality
- Examples: [[Judith Butler]], [[Julia Kristeva]]

## Key Debates and Controversies

### Equality vs. Difference Debate
**Equality Feminists**: Emphasize women's similarity to men, seek equal treatment
**Difference Feminists**: Emphasize women's distinctive qualities, seek recognition of difference

**Contemporary Resolution**
- Recognition that both equality and difference claims can be strategic
- [[Joan Scott]]'s analysis of equality vs. difference as false dilemma
- Emphasis on context-dependent approaches

### Essentialism vs. Anti-Essentialism
**Essentialist Position**: Some qualities or experiences are essentially feminine
**Anti-Essentialist Position**: All gender qualities are socially constructed

**Butler's Intervention**
- Critique of both positions as assuming stable identity categories
- Focus on performativity as alternative to essence/construction debate
- Recognition of strategic value in provisional identity claims

### Universal vs. Particular
**Universalist Approaches**: Seek ethical principles applicable to all women
**Particularist Approaches**: Emphasize differences among women's experiences

**Intersectionality Response**
- [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]]'s analysis of multiple, intersecting identities
- Recognition that race, class, sexuality shape gender experience differently
- Challenge to unified "women's experience"

## Contemporary Applications and Issues

- Critique of medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth
- Questions about surrogacy, egg donation, and commodification
- [[Susan Sherwin]]'s relational approach to reproductive choice

## Methodological Innovations

### Consciousness-Raising as Ethical Method
- Collective reflection on shared experiences
- Challenge to separation of personal and political
- Development of knowledge from women's standpoint
- Alternative to abstract philosophical reasoning

### Narrative and Storytelling
- Recognition of narrative as legitimate source of moral knowledge
- Attention to whose stories get told and heard
- Connection between narrative identity and ethical agency
- Examples in [[Miranda Fricker]]'s epistemic injustice work

### Embodied Ethics
- Challenge to mind/body dualism in traditional ethics
- Attention to emotional, physical, and relational dimensions of ethics
- Connection to [[phenomenology]] and embodied experience
- [[Susan Bordo]]'s analysis of body and culture

## Criticisms and Responses

### Internal Criticisms
**Exclusion of Difference**: Early feminism focused primarily on white, middle-class women
**Response**: Development of intersectional and multicultural approaches

**Anti-Male Bias**: Some forms of feminism seen as hostile to men
**Response**: Development of more inclusive approaches recognizing men's stake in feminist goals

### External Criticisms
**Special Pleading**: Feminist ethics accused of abandoning universality for partiality
**Response**: Critique of purported universality as masking particular (male) perspectives

**Relativism**: Feminist emphasis on difference accused of leading to moral relativism
**Response**: Distinction between contextual sensitivity and relativism

## Connections to Other Ideas

## Contemporary Significance
Feminist ethics continues to evolve, incorporating insights from critical race theory, queer theory, postcolonial feminism, and other perspectives. Its methodological innovations, theoretical insights, and practical applications have profoundly influenced academic philosophy, public policy, and social movements. The ongoing development of intersectional, transnational, and posthuman feminist ethics demonstrates its continued vitality and relevance to contemporary moral questions.
