# Deontological Ethics

**Author**: [[individuals/immanuel-kant|Kant]]

**Year**: 1785

**Historical Period**: [[periods/enlightenment|Enlightenment]]

**Tags**: #Ethics, #Moral Philosophy

## Description

The ethical theory that the rightness or wrongness of actions depends on adherence to moral rules or duties, regardless of consequences. Actions are morally right when they conform to universal moral laws that can be rationally derived and apply to all rational beings.

- **responds_to**: Moral sense theorists who based ethics on sentiment rather than reason
- **builds_upon**: Rational autonomy and dignity of persons as foundational values
- **influenced_by**: Christian ethics' emphasis on duty and universal moral law

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/w-d-ross|W.D. Ross]]'s prima facie duties and moral intuitionism
- **influences**: Contemporary deontological theories and rights-based approaches

- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/virtue-ethics|Virtue Ethics]] revival challenging rule-based approaches

## Notes

**Kantian Foundations:**

**Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals (1785):**

**Good Will:**
- Only unconditional good is good will (intention to act from duty)
- Consequences irrelevant to moral worth
- Acting from duty vs acting in accordance with duty
- Moral worth lies in motivation, not outcome

**Categorical Imperative:**
**First Formulation (Universal Law):**
"Act only according to maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."
- Universalizability test for moral maxims
- Self-defeating maxims (lying, false promising) fail test
- Rational consistency as foundation of morality

**Second Formulation (Humanity):**
"Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never merely as a means."
- Persons have dignity, not price
- Rational autonomy grounds inherent worth
- Prohibition on using people merely instrumentally

**Third Formulation (Kingdom of Ends):**
"Act as if you were through your maxims legislating member in a universal kingdom of ends."
- Community of rational beings as co-legislators
- Moral laws self-imposed through reason
- Autonomy as foundation of moral authority

**Key Concepts:**

**Autonomy:**
- Self-legislation through reason
- Freedom from heteronomy (external authority)
- Rational beings create moral law through reason
- Dignity stems from capacity for autonomous moral action

**Duty:**
- Moral obligations binding regardless of inclination
- Perfect duties: Admit no exceptions (don't lie, don't murder)
- Imperfect duties: Allow discretion in application (help others, develop talents)
- Duty vs inclination: Moral worth requires acting against desire when necessary

**Contemporary Developments:**

**Ross's Prima Facie Duties:**
- Multiple duties that can conflict in particular situations
- Promise-keeping, non-maleficence, justice, gratitude, etc.
- Actual duty determined by strongest prima facie duty in context
- Moral intuitionism: We intuit moral truths directly

**Rights-Based Deontology:**
- Focus on individual rights as moral constraints
- Rights as "side-constraints" on permissible action
- Natural rights tradition updated with Kantian foundations
- Robert Nozick's libertarian rights theory

**Contractualist Deontology:**
- Moral principles those that could be agreed to by rational contractors
- Rawls's veil of ignorance as device for fair agreement
- T.M. Scanlon's contractualism: "What we owe to each other"
- Reasons that others could not reasonably reject

**Arguments For Deontological Ethics:**

1. **Moral Intuitions**: Captures intuitions about moral absolutes (don't torture innocents)
2. **Human Dignity**: Respects inherent worth of persons regardless of utility
3. **Universality**: Provides universal moral principles transcending culture
4. **Autonomy**: Grounds morality in rational agency rather than external authority
5. **Justice**: Explains why some acts wrong regardless of good consequences

**Arguments Against Deontological Ethics:**

1. **Conflicting Duties**: No clear resolution when duties conflict
2. **Consequences Matter**: Seems wrong to ignore terrible consequences
3. **Rigidity**: Universal rules may require harmful actions in extreme cases
4. **Action Guidance**: Abstract principles provide little concrete guidance
5. **Cultural Variation**: Supposed universal duties vary across cultures

**Contemporary Applications:**

**Medical Ethics:**
- Informed consent as respect for autonomy
- Truth-telling duty even when harmful
- Non-maleficence as absolute constraint
- Patient rights as deontological constraints

**Business Ethics:**
- Duties to stakeholders regardless of profitability
- Honesty in advertising as categorical duty
- Worker rights as moral constraints on profit

**International Relations:**
- Human rights as universal moral constraints
- Just war theory and rules of warfare
- Treaties and international law as binding duties

**Applied Ethics Problems:**

**Trolley Problem:**
- Is it permissible to divert trolley to kill one instead of five?
- Distinction between killing and letting die
- Doctrine of double effect
- Using person as mere means vs side-effect

**Lying to Save Lives:**
- Nazi at door asking about hidden Jews
- Conflict between truth-telling duty and life-saving
- Some Kantians: Lie is always wrong
- Others: Murderer forfeits right to truth
