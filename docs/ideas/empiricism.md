# Empiricism

**Author**: [[individuals/john-locke|Locke]]

**Year**: 1689

**Historical Period**: [[periods/early-modern-philosophy|Early Modern Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Epistemology, #Philosophy of Science

## Description

The epistemological doctrine that all knowledge comes from sensory experience. The mind begins as a "blank slate" (tabula rasa) and acquires all concepts and knowledge through sensation and reflection on sensory data.

## Influenced By

- **responds_to**: [[ideas/divine-illumination|Divine Illumination]] by [[individuals/augustine|Augustine]] - Locke sought natural rather than supernatural source of knowledge
- **responds_to**: [[ideas/rationalism|Rationalism]] by [[individuals/descartes|Descartes]] - Rejected innate ideas and purely rational knowledge
- **builds_upon**: Francis Bacon's emphasis on observation and induction in natural philosophy

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/david-hume|Hume]]'s more radical empiricism questioning causation and induction
- **influences**: [[individuals/george-berkeley|Berkeley]]'s [[ideas/immaterialism|Immaterialism]] - "Esse est percipi" takes empiricism to idealistic conclusion
- **influences**: [[ideas/logical-positivism|Logical Positivism]] and verification principle
- **influences**: [[ideas/pragmatism|Pragmatism]] by [[individuals/william-james|James]] and [[individuals/john-dewey|Dewey]]
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/rationalism|Rationalism]] by [[individuals/gottfried-leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[individuals/immanuel-kant|Kant]]
- **influences**: Contemporary philosophy of science and epistemology

## Notes

**Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689):**

**Tabula Rasa**: Mind begins as blank slate with no innate ideas
- Against Cartesian innate ideas (God, infinity, perfection)
- Against universal consent arguments for innateness
- All concepts derived from experience

**Two Sources of Ideas:**
1. **Sensation**: External objects affect our senses (sight, hearing, touch, etc.)
2. **Reflection**: Internal perception of mind's operations (thinking, willing, believing)

**Simple vs Complex Ideas:**
- Simple ideas: Received passively from sensation/reflection (red, sweet, thinking)
- Complex ideas: Mind actively combines simple ideas (substance, relation, mode)

**Primary vs Secondary Qualities:**
- Primary: Size, shape, motion - resemble qualities in objects
- Secondary: Color, taste, sound - powers to produce sensations in us

**British Empiricist Development:**

**Berkeley's Idealistic Turn:**
- Rejected primary/secondary distinction
- "Esse est percipi" - being is being perceived
- Material substance unnecessary hypothesis

**Hume's Skeptical Consequences:**
- Problem of induction: No rational justification for inductive inference
- Problem of causation: Only constant conjunction, not necessary connection
- No empirical foundation for substantial self

**Kant's Critical Response:**
- Synthetic a priori knowledge required for experience
- Categories of understanding structure experience
- "Thoughts without content empty, intuitions without concepts blind"

**Contemporary Developments:**
- Logical empiricism: Knowledge from observation plus logic/mathematics
- Quine's critique: Holistic web of belief, no pure observation sentences
- Theory-ladenness: Observation influenced by theoretical commitments
- Naturalized epistemology: Replace traditional foundations with psychology/science

**Arguments For Empiricism:**
1. Plausible psychological account of concept acquisition
2. Success of experimental science based on observation
3. Skepticism about purely rational metaphysical speculation
4. Democratic epistemology: Anyone can observe

**Arguments Against:**
1. Problem of induction unsolved
2. Theory-ladenness of observation
3. Mathematical and logical knowledge seems non-empirical
4. Conceptual analysis yields substantive knowledge
