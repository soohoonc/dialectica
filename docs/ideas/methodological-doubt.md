# Methodological Doubt

**Author**: [[individuals/descartes|Descartes]]

**Year**: 1637

**Historical Period**: [[periods/early-modern-philosophy|Early Modern Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Epistemology, #Method

## Description

The systematic procedure of doubting all beliefs that can possibly be false in order to discover indubitable foundations for knowledge. Unlike skeptical doubt, methodological doubt is employed as a tool to establish certain knowledge rather than to deny its possibility.

## Influenced By

- **responds_to**: Ancient skepticism, especially Pyrrhonian and Academic traditions
- **responds_to**: Scholastic disagreements and lack of certain foundations
- **builds_upon**: Mathematical methods seeking absolute certainty
- **influenced_by**: Augustine's use of doubt to establish certain self-knowledge

## Influences

- **influences**: [[ideas/rationalism|Rationalism]] as epistemological program based on indubitable foundations
- **influences**: [[individuals/david-hume|Hume]]'s more radical skepticism about causation and induction
- **influences**: [[individuals/immanuel-kant|Kant]]'s critical philosophy responding to Humean skepticism
- **influences**: [[ideas/phenomenology|Phenomenology]] by [[individuals/edmund-husserl|Husserl]] using epoché or bracketing
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/empiricism|Empiricism]] for rejecting sensory experience as foundation

## Notes

**The Method in Discourse on Method (1637) and Meditations (1641):**

**First Meditation - What Can Be Called Into Doubt:**

1. **Sensory Deception**: Senses sometimes deceive us (distant objects, optical illusions)
   - But maybe only small/distant things are doubtful?
   - Counter: Dreams make even immediate sensations unreliable

2. **Dream Argument**: Cannot distinguish waking from dreaming experience
   - Same sensations occur in dreams as waking
   - No reliable criteria for distinguishing states
   - But maybe simple natures (mathematics) remain certain?

3. **Evil Demon Hypothesis**: Powerful deceiver might cause all our experiences
   - Even mathematical truths might be deceptions
   - Everything we believe about external world could be false
   - Hyperbolical doubt pushes skepticism to maximum

**Second Meditation - Cogito Ergo Sum:**
- Cannot doubt that I exist while thinking/doubting
- "I am, I exist" is necessarily true whenever conceived
- Establishes thinking self as indubitable foundation
- But what am I? A thinking thing (res cogitans)

**Subsequent Meditations - Reconstruction:**
- God's existence proven from idea of perfect being
- God's perfection guarantees He's not a deceiver  
- Clear and distinct perceptions therefore reliable
- External world's existence re-established through divine guarantee

**Responses and Criticisms:**

**Contemporary Objections:**
- **Circle Objection**: Uses clear/distinct ideas to prove God, then God to validate clear/distinct ideas
- **Certainty vs. Knowledge**: Psychological certainty doesn't guarantee truth
- **Dreaming Criterion**: No absolute distinction between dream and waking experience

**Hume's Radicalization:**
- Extended doubt to causation: No necessary connection between cause/effect
- Problem of induction: No rational justification for future resembling past
- Bundle theory of self: No substantial self, only bundle of perceptions

**Kant's Response to Skepticism:**
- Transcendental arguments: Conditions necessary for possibility of experience
- Synthetic a priori knowledge: Experience structured by rational categories
- Phenomena vs. noumena: Can know appearances, not things-in-themselves

**Contemporary Relevance:**
- **Brain in Vat**: Modern version of evil demon hypothesis
- **External World Problem**: How to move from inner experience to outer reality
- **Foundationalism vs. Coherentism**: Basic beliefs vs. web of mutually supporting beliefs
- **Epistemic Closure**: If S knows P and P entails Q, does S know Q?

**Methodological vs. Real Doubt:**
Descartes claimed his doubt was merely methodological - a tool for discovering truth rather than genuine skepticism. Critics question whether this distinction can be maintained given the radical nature of the doubt employed.
