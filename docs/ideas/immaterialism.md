# Immaterialism

**Author**: [[individuals/george-berkeley|Berkeley]]

**Year**: 1710

**Historical Period**: [[periods/early-modern-philosophy|Early Modern Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Metaphysics, #Epistemology

## Description

The philosophical doctrine that material substance does not exist; only minds and ideas exist. Physical objects are collections of ideas perceived by minds, with God as the ultimate perceiver ensuring their continued existence.

## Influenced By

- **criticizes**: [[ideas/tabula-rasa|Tabula Rasa]] by [[individuals/john-locke|Locke]] - Berkeley rejected Locke's material substance and distinction between primary/secondary qualities
- **responds_to**: [[ideas/methodological-doubt|Methodological Doubt]] by [[individuals/descartes|Descartes]] - Used similar skeptical arguments but reached idealistic rather than dualistic conclusions
- **builds_upon**: [[ideas/occasionalism|Occasionalism]] by [[individuals/nicolas-malebranche|Malebranche]] - Adopted the view that God is the true cause of all our perceptions

## Influences

- **influences**: [[ideas/phenomenology|Phenomenology]] by [[individuals/edmund-husserl|Husserl]] - Berkeley's focus on immediate experience anticipates phenomenological reduction
- **influences**: [[individuals/immanuel-kant|Kant]]'s transcendental idealism - Kant's distinction between phenomena and noumena partly responds to Berkeley
- **criticized_by**: [[individuals/david-hume|Hume]] in [[ideas/is-ought-problem|Skeptical Philosophy]] - Hume questioned Berkeley's reliance on God and substantial self
- **influences**: Modern philosophy of mind debates about [[ideas/intentionality|Intentionality]] and direct realism

## Notes

Berkeley's *Principles of Human Knowledge* argues for immaterialism through several key steps:

1. **Esse est percipi** (To be is to be perceived) - Physical objects are nothing but collections of sensible qualities
2. **No abstract ideas** - We cannot conceive material substance apart from its qualities
3. **Primary/secondary quality criticism** - Even supposedly objective qualities like shape and size are mind-dependent
4. **Divine perception** - God's eternal perception explains the persistence of objects when unperceived by finite minds

Berkeley aimed to refute skepticism and atheism by eliminating matter as a potential source of error. If everything is mental, we have direct access to reality through perception. This makes Berkeley both an empiricist (all knowledge from experience) and an idealist (only minds and ideas exist).

Contemporary philosophers debate whether Berkeley's position is coherent. [[individuals/daniel-dennett|Dennett]] sees Berkeley as anticipating eliminative materialism about qualia, while others find resources for direct realist theories of perception.
