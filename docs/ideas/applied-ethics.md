# Applied Ethics

## Core Concept
Applied ethics involves the application of moral theories, principles, and reasoning to specific practical problems in real-world contexts, bridging abstract philosophical reflection and concrete decision-making.

## Historical Development

### Philosophical Precedents
While contemporary applied ethics emerged in the 1960s-70s, earlier philosophers addressed practical moral questions:
- [[Aristotle]]'s *Nicomachean Ethics* - virtue in practical contexts
- [[Thomas Aquinas]] - natural law applications to specific cases
- [[Jeremy Bentham]] - utilitarian analysis of legal and social reform
- [[John Stuart Mill]] - harm principle and liberty applications

### Modern Revival (1960s-1970s)

**Social Context**
- Civil rights movement and social justice concerns
- Technological advances raising new ethical questions
- Professional ethics scandals demanding philosophical attention
- Student activism and relevance of academic philosophy

**Institutional Development**
- Philosophy and Public Affairs journal (1971)
- Professional ethics centers and programs
- Interdisciplinary collaboration with law, medicine, business
- Government ethics commissions and advisory bodies

### Peter Singer's Influence

**Practical Ethics Approach**
[[Peter Singer]]'s *Practical Ethics* (1979) exemplified applied ethics methodology:
- **Utilitarian framework**: maximize overall well-being
- **Equal consideration of interests**: species, race, and nationality irrelevant to moral consideration
- **Controversial conclusions**: infanticide, euthanasia, animal liberation
- **Public engagement**: writing for general audiences, not just academics

**Singer's Methodological Principles**
1. **Start with intuitive judgments**: common moral beliefs as starting points
2. **Apply consistent reasoning**: follow arguments to logical conclusions
3. **Revise intuitions when necessary**: philosophy should challenge conventional wisdom
4. **Consider practical consequences**: abstract principles must guide real-world action

## Major Areas of Applied Ethics

## Methodological Approaches

### Top-Down Approach
**Process**: Apply established moral theories to specific cases
**Advantages**: Systematic, consistent, theoretically grounded
**Challenges**: Theories may conflict or give counterintuitive results
**Example**: Using [[Kantian Ethics]] to evaluate lying in medicine

### Bottom-Up Approach
**Process**: Start with particular cases and moral intuitions, develop principles
**Advantages**: Responsive to context, builds on shared judgments
**Challenges**: May lack theoretical coherence, vulnerable to bias
**Example**: [[Case study]] methodology in medical ethics

### Reflective Equilibrium
[[John Rawls]]'s method for applied ethics:
1. **Start with considered judgments**: moral beliefs we hold with confidence
2. **Formulate principles**: general rules that explain our judgments
3. **Check for consistency**: revise judgments or principles as needed
4. **Achieve equilibrium**: stable balance between principles and judgments

### Principlism
**Four Principles Approach** ([[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[James Childress]]):
1. **Autonomy**: respecting persons' self-determination
2. **Beneficence**: acting in others' best interests
3. **Non-maleficence**: avoiding harm
4. **Justice**: fair distribution of benefits and burdens

### Casuistry
- **Case-based reasoning**: moral reasoning through analysis of paradigm cases
- **Analogical thinking**: applying lessons from similar cases
- **Contextual sensitivity**: attention to particular circumstances
- **Professional tradition**: building on accumulated practical wisdom
