# Foundationalism

**Author**: [[individuals/descartes|Descartes]]

**Year**: 1641

**Historical Period**: [[periods/early-modern-philosophy|Early Modern Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Epistemology, #Justification

## Description

The epistemological theory that knowledge has a hierarchical structure with basic beliefs that are self-evident or indubitable serving as foundations for all other justified beliefs. These foundational beliefs require no further justification and support all derivative knowledge.

## Influenced By

- **responds_to**: [[ideas/skepticism|Skepticism]] and the regress problem in justification
- **builds_upon**: Mathematical model of knowledge with axioms and theorems
- **influenced_by**: Aristotelian conception of demonstrative science with first principles
- **responds_to**: Need for certain and systematic knowledge

## Influences

- **influences**: [[ideas/empiricism|Empiricism]] by [[individuals/john-locke|Locke]] - sensory experience as foundation
- **influences**: [[ideas/logical-positivism|Logical Positivism]] - protocol sentences as observational foundation
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/coherentism|Coherentism]] arguing for holistic justification
- **criticized_by**: [[individuals/w-v-o-quine|Quine]] and [[individuals/wilfrid-sellars|Sellars]]'s attack on "given" foundations
- **influences**: Contemporary reliabilism and externalist theories of justification

## Notes

**The Foundationalist Structure:**

**Basic Beliefs (Foundations):**
- Self-justified or self-evident
- Require no inferential support from other beliefs
- Provide stopping point for regress of justification
- Must be certain (classical) or highly justified (modest foundationalism)

**Non-Basic Beliefs:**
- Derive justification from basic beliefs
- Justified through inference (deductive, inductive, abductive)
- Form superstructure built on foundational base
- Include most of our ordinary knowledge claims

**The Epistemic Regress Problem:**
1. Belief P justified only if supported by justified belief Q
2. Q justified only if supported by justified belief R  
3. R justified only if supported by justified belief S
4. Either: (a) Infinite regress, (b) Circular reasoning, (c) Foundational stopping point, or (d) Skepticism

Foundationalists choose option (c) - basic beliefs stop the regress.

**Classical Foundationalism:**

**Cartesian Version:**
- Foundations must be indubitable and self-evident
- Cogito ergo sum as paradigm basic belief
- Mathematical and logical truths as foundations
- Sensory beliefs require inferential support

**Empiricist Version:**
- Sense experience provides foundations
- "Seems red to me now" reports immediately justified
- Observation statements incorrigible or self-presenting
- Theoretical beliefs inferred from observational base

**Problems with Classical Foundationalism:**

**Sellars's "Myth of the Given":**
- No beliefs are immune from revision
- Observational reports involve conceptual interpretation
- No sharp distinction between observational and theoretical
- Foundations themselves require conceptual sophistication

**Theory-Ladenness:**
- Observations influenced by theoretical commitments
- No "pure" observational language
- Background theories affect what we observe
- Holistic character of belief systems

**Contemporary Foundationalism:**

**Modest Foundationalism:**
- Basic beliefs need not be certain, only prima facie justified
- Foundations can be defeated by other considerations
- Allows fallibilistic epistemology while maintaining structure
- Examples: Memory beliefs, testimony, perceptual experiences

**Reformed Epistemology:**
- Religious beliefs as properly basic
- Belief in God justified without propositional evidence
- Critique of classical foundationalism's narrow conception of basicality
- [[individuals/alvin-plantinga|Plantinga]]'s critique of evidentialism

**Reliabilist Foundationalism:**
- Basic beliefs produced by reliable cognitive processes
- No requirement for internal access to reliability
- Externalist approach to justification
- Process reliabilism as foundation for knowledge

**Arguments For Foundationalism:**
1. **Regress Problem**: Infinite regress or circularity unacceptable
2. **Intuitive Appeal**: Some beliefs seem immediately evident
3. **Scientific Method**: Observation reports as foundation for theory
4. **Logical Structure**: Parallels axiomatic systems in mathematics
5. **Avoiding Skepticism**: Provides secure basis for knowledge

**Arguments Against:**
1. **Myth of the Given**: No beliefs immune from revision
2. **Isolation Objection**: Basic beliefs lack adequate justification
3. **Theory-Ladenness**: Observation involves theoretical interpretation
4. **Holism**: Beliefs gain support from entire web, not foundations alone
5. **Cultural Relativity**: What counts as basic varies across contexts
