# Qualia

## Core Concept
Qualia are the intrinsic, qualitative, subjective properties of conscious experiences - the \"what it's like\" aspect of mental states, such as the redness of red, the painfulness of pain, or the taste of chocolate, which seem resistant to physical or functional explanation.

## Historical Development

### Early Philosophical Recognition

**John Locke's Secondary Qualities**
[[John Locke]] distinguished primary and secondary qualities:
- **Primary qualities**: objective properties like shape, motion, solidity
- **Secondary qualities**: subjective properties like color, taste, smell
- **Ideas in mind**: secondary qualities as mental representations
- **Resemblance theory**: primary qualities resemble external properties, secondary do not

**David Hume's Impressions**
[[David Hume]] emphasized immediate conscious experience:
- **Impressions vs. ideas**: vivid immediate experience vs. copies in thought
- **Simple vs. complex**: basic experiential elements and combinations
- **Missing shade of blue**: can we have ideas without corresponding impressions?
- **Phenomenological focus**: attention to character of experience itself

**Immanuel Kant's Phenomena**
[[Immanuel Kant]]'s transcendental idealism addressed appearance vs. reality:
- **Phenomena vs. noumena**: things as they appear vs. things in themselves
- **Transcendental aesthetic**: space and time as forms of sensibility
- **Synthesis**: mind actively constructing experienced world
- **Limits of knowledge**: no access to things as they are independently of experience

### 19th Century Developments

**Franz Brentano's Intentionality**
[[Franz Brentano]] distinguished mental from physical phenomena:
- **Intentional inexistence**: mental states directed toward objects
- **Descriptive psychology**: careful description of mental phenomena
- **Primary vs. secondary consciousness**: awareness and awareness of awareness
- **Phenomenology foundation**: influence on Husserl and phenomenological tradition

**William James' Stream of Consciousness**
[[William James]] provided detailed analysis of conscious experience:
- **Stream metaphor**: consciousness as flowing rather than discrete elements
- **Fringe**: vague borderline of consciousness beyond clear focus
- **Selective attention**: consciousness as selective and purposive
- **Pure experience**: radical empiricism treating experience as fundamental

### 20th Century Phenomenology

**Edmund Husserl's Phenomenological Method**
[[Edmund Husserl]] developed systematic study of consciousness:
- **[[Phenomenological Reduction]]**: bracketing natural attitude to study pure consciousness
- **Intentionality**: consciousness always consciousness of something
- **Noesis-noema**: act of consciousness and its object-as-intended
- **Temporal synthesis**: consciousness as temporally structured

**Maurice Merleau-Ponty's Embodied Phenomenology**
[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] emphasized bodily basis of experience:
- **Body schema**: pre-reflective sense of body in space
- **Perceptual faith**: direct contact with world through perception
- **Intercorporeality**: shared bodily experience with others
- **Critique of intellectualism**: experience not reducible to judgments

## Contemporary Philosophical Debates

### The Knowledge Argument

**Frank Jackson's Mary**
[[Frank Jackson]] presented influential thought experiment:
- **Mary the color scientist**: knows all physical facts about color but has never seen color
- **Learning something new**: upon first seeing red, Mary learns something
- **Knowledge argument**: physical facts don't exhaust all facts
- **Qualia as non-physical**: subjective experience irreducible to physical properties

**Physicalist Responses**
- **Ability hypothesis**: Mary gains new abilities, not new propositional knowledge
- **Phenomenal concept strategy**: new concepts for same physical facts
- **Knowledge how vs. knowledge that**: different types of knowledge
- **Jackson's conversion**: Jackson later adopted physicalist position

**Lewis and Nemirow's Ability Hypothesis**
- **David Lewis**: knowing what it's like is ability to recognize and imagine
- **Laurence Nemirow**: phenomenal concepts as mental representations
- **Skills and dispositions**: experiential knowledge as practical abilities
- **Cognitive vs. ontological**: knowledge difference vs. metaphysical difference

### Philosophical Zombies

**David Chalmers' Zombie Argument**
[[David Chalmers]] defended conceivability of zombies:
- **Philosophical zombies**: beings physically identical to us but lacking consciousness
- **Conceivability**: zombies seem conceivable, therefore metaphysically possible
- **Modal argument**: if zombies possible, physicalism false
- **Two-dimensional semantics**: primary vs. secondary intensions

**Physicalist Responses**
- **Inconceivability**: zombies not really conceivable upon careful reflection
- **Conceivability-possibility gap**: conceivable doesn't entail possible
- **Phenomenal concept strategy**: explaining intuitions without accepting dualism
- **A posteriori physicalism**: identity discovered empirically, not a priori

**Type-A vs. Type-B Physicalism**
- **Type-A**: deny intuitions about zombies and knowledge argument
- **Type-B**: accept intuitions but explain through conceptual differences
- **Phenomenal concept strategy**: special concepts for physical states
- **Explanatory gap**: difference between epistemic and metaphysical gaps

### Inverted Spectra

**Systematic Inversion**
- **Inverted qualia**: what causes red experience in me causes green experience in you
- **Behavioral equivalence**: no behavioral differences between us
- **Functionalist challenge**: if functionally identical, same mental state
- **Qualitative difference**: different subjective experience despite same function

**Responses and Developments**
- **Wittgenstein's beetle**: private nature irrelevant to meaning
- **Behaviorist denial**: no meaningful difference without behavioral difference
- **Functionalist accommodation**: allowing for inverted but functionally equivalent states
- **Absent qualia**: more extreme case of functional duplicate without consciousness

### Explanatory Gap

**Joseph Levine's Formulation**
[[Joseph Levine]] identified explanatory gap:
- **Physical-phenomenal gap**: no intelligible connection between brain states and experience
- **Water-H2O vs. pain-C-fibers**: different types of identity
- **Conceptual vs. empirical**: a priori vs. a posteriori necessity
- **Epistemic problem**: gap in understanding, not necessarily metaphysical

**Hard Problem Connection**
[[David Chalmers]] related explanatory gap to hard problem:
- **Easy problems**: cognitive functions and behavioral capacities
- **Hard problem**: why there is subjective experience at all
- **Explanatory irreducibility**: no amount of functional explanation explains qualia
- **Consciousness as fundamental**: like mass or charge in physics

## Varieties and Properties of Qualia

### Subjectivity

**First-Person Ontology**
- **Subjective existence**: qualia exist only from first-person perspective
- **Perspectival properties**: properties relative to experiencing subject
- **[[Thomas Nagel]]'s point**: objective science cannot capture subjective viewpoint
- **Phenomenal vs. physical**: different modes of existence

**Access and Knowledge**
- **Privileged access**: special access to own mental states
- **Infallibility**: can one be mistaken about own qualia?
- **Transparency**: awareness of mental states vs. awareness through them
- **Self-knowledge**: nature of introspective knowledge

### Privacy

**Other Minds Problem**
- **Asymmetry**: direct access to own qualia, indirect to others'
- **Behavioral criteria**: inferring others' experience from behavior
- **Analogical argument**: reasoning from own case to others
- **Problem of knowledge**: how can we know others have qualia?

**Wittgenstein's Critique**
- **Private language argument**: no purely private meaningful language
