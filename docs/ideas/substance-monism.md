# Substance Monism

**Author**: [[individuals/spinoza|Spinoza]]

**Year**: 1677

**Historical Period**: [[periods/early-modern-philosophy|Early Modern Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Metaphysics, #Ontology

## Description

The metaphysical doctrine that there is only one substance in existence, which Spinoza identified with God or Nature (Deus sive Natura). This substance has infinite attributes, of which we know only two: thought and extension.

## Influenced By

- **criticizes**: [[ideas/cogito-ergo-sum|Cogito Ergo Sum]] by [[individuals/descartes|Descartes]] - Spinoza rejected Cartesian dualism as creating the impossible problem of mind-body interaction
- **builds_upon**: [[ideas/divine-illumination|Divine Illumination]] by [[individuals/augustine|Augustine]] - Adopted the idea of God as the source of all truth and being
- **responds_to**: [[ideas/occasionalism|Occasionalism]] by [[individuals/nicolas-malebranche|Malebranche]] - Rejected the need for divine intervention in causation

## Influences

- **influences**: [[ideas/materialism|Materialism]] by [[individuals/karl-marx|Marx]] - Marx's dialectical materialism drew on Spinoza's monistic naturalism
- **influences**: [[ideas/panpsychism|Panpsychism]] by [[individuals/alfred-north-whitehead|Whitehead]] - Modern panpsychists cite Spinoza's dual-aspect theory
- **influences**: [[ideas/phenomenology|Phenomenology]] by [[individuals/maurice-merleau-ponty|Merleau-Ponty]] - Merleau-Ponty's embodied cognition reflects Spinozist mind-body unity
- **criticized_by**: [[individuals/gottfried-leibniz|Leibniz]] in [[ideas/monadology|Monadology]] - Leibniz argued for plurality of substances against Spinoza's monism

## Notes

Spinoza's *Ethics* presents substance monism through geometric demonstration. Key propositions include: "Whatever is, is in God" and "God is the immanent, not transitive, cause of all things." This radical immanentism eliminates traditional distinctions between creator and creation, mind and body, freedom and necessity.

The doctrine emerged from Spinoza's critique of Cartesian dualism's interaction problem. If mind and body are distinct substances, how can they causally interact? Spinoza's solution: they are two aspects of one substance, like two sides of a coin.

Contemporary physicalists like [[individuals/daniel-dennett|Dennett]] see Spinoza as a precursor to eliminative materialism, while philosophers of mind like [[individuals/david-chalmers|Chalmers]] find resources for addressing the hard problem of consciousness.
