# Care Ethics

## Core Concept
Care ethics emphasizes the moral significance of caring relationships, attentiveness to particular needs, and the context-dependent nature of ethical decision-making. It challenges abstract, rule-based ethical theories by foregrounding relational responsibility and emotional engagement.

## Historical Development

### Origins: Gender and Moral Development
The emergence of care ethics arose from feminist critiques of traditional moral psychology and ethical theory in the 1980s.

**Carol Gilligan's Challenge to Kohlberg**
- [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] proposed stages of moral development emphasizing justice and rights
- [[Carol Gilligan]] identified a "different voice" in moral reasoning - care versus justice orientation
- Gilligan argued women often prioritized maintaining relationships and responding to needs over abstract principles
- Her work challenged the universality and gender-neutrality of Kohlberg's justice-based model

### Philosophical Development

**Nel Noddings' Systematic Approach**
[[Nel Noddings]] transformed Gilligan's psychological observations into a comprehensive ethical framework:
- **Natural caring**: spontaneous care arising from affection and attachment
- **Ethical caring**: deliberate commitment to care when natural caring fails
- **The cared-for**: reciprocity in caring relationships, though not necessarily equal
- **Moral education**: developing caring competence rather than rule-following

**Core Components of Caring**
1. **Attentiveness**: awareness of others' needs and vulnerabilities
2. **Responsibility**: taking on the work of care
3. **Competence**: developing skills to care effectively
4. **Responsiveness**: ensuring care meets actual rather than projected needs

## Major Debates and Developments

### Care vs. Justice Debate
The relationship between care and justice ethics remains contested:

**Complementarity View**
- [[Susan Wolf]] and others argue care and justice address different moral domains
- Private relationships benefit from care ethics, public sphere requires justice
- Both orientations necessary for complete moral framework

**Integration Approaches**
- [[Annette Baier]] advocates for integrating care and justice concerns
- Care provides emotional foundation for justice; justice provides structure for care
- Neither alone sufficient for comprehensive ethics

**Feminist Justice Theory Response**
- [[Martha Nussbaum]] develops capabilities approach incorporating care concerns
- [[Eva Feder Kittay]] argues justice theory must acknowledge dependency relationships
- Challenge to assume independent, autonomous agents in justice theory

### Scope and Application Debates

**Universalizability Questions**
- Can care ethics extend beyond intimate relationships?
- [[Joan Tronto]] develops "political ethics of care" for public institutions
- Debate over whether care ethics can address global justice issues

**Cultural Relativism Concerns**
- Does emphasis on context lead to moral relativism?
- [[Virginia Held]] argues care ethics has universal elements while remaining contextual
- Tension between situational responsiveness and moral standards

### Contemporary Developments

**Intersectionality and Care**
- [[Patricia Hill Collins]] examines how race, class, and gender shape caring experiences
- Recognition that care work often falls disproportionately on marginalized communities
- Analysis of how power structures affect who gives and receives care

**Global Care Ethics**
- Extension to international relations and global justice
- [[Fiona Robinson]] applies care ethics to international political theory
- Attention to global care chains and transnational caring relationships

**Environmental Care Ethics**
- [[Ecological feminism]] draws connections between care for persons and nature
- [[Val Plumwood]] develops relational environmental ethics
- Challenge to anthropocentric approaches to environmental issues

## Contemporary Relevance and Applications

### Healthcare Ethics
Care ethics significantly influences medical ethics:
- Patient-centered care models
- Attention to care relationships in healthcare settings
- Challenge to purely principle-based medical ethics

### Educational Philosophy
- Alternative to character education focused on rule-following
- Emphasis on developing caring relationships in schools
- Attention to moral education through modeling and practice

### Social Policy

### Technology and Care

- Analysis of how digital technologies affect caring practices
- Ethical evaluation of care robots and AI in caring contexts

## Criticisms and Responses

### Gender Essentialism Critique
**Criticism**: Care ethics reinforces traditional gender roles
**Response**: Later theorists emphasize care as learned practice, not natural feminine trait

### Limited Scope Critique
**Criticism**: Care ethics cannot address large-scale social justice issues
**Response**: Development of political care ethics and institutional applications

### Parochialism Critique
**Criticism**: Care ethics promotes favoritism and cannot be universalized
**Response**: Distinction between caring attention to particulars and unfair partiality

### Sentimentality Critique
**Criticism**: Care ethics is too emotional and subjective
**Response**: Emphasis on competent care requiring knowledge, skill, and judgment

## Connections to Other Ideas
- **[[Virtue Ethics]]**: Shared emphasis on character and relationships
- **[[Feminist Ethics]]**: Broader framework within which care ethics developed
- **[[Applied Ethics]]**: Practical applications in healthcare, education, and policy
- **[[Phenomenology]]**: Attention to lived experience and embodied relationships
- **[[Communitarianism]]**: Critique of individualistic moral frameworks

## Contemporary Significance
Care ethics continues to evolve as a significant alternative to deontological and consequentialist ethics. Its emphasis on relationships, context, and emotional engagement offers valuable insights for personal ethics, professional practice, and social policy. The ongoing development of political care ethics and its application to global issues demonstrates its continued relevance beyond its original domains.
