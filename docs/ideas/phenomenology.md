# Phenomenology

**Author**: [[individuals/edmund-husserl|Husserl]]

**Year**: 1900

**Historical Period**: [[periods/contemporary-philosophy|Contemporary Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Epistemology, #Philosophy of Mind

## Description

The philosophical method of studying consciousness by examining the structures of experience as they present themselves to consciousness, without recourse to questions about their existence in the external world. Focuses on the essential structures of experience and meaning.

## Influenced By

- **responds_to**: Psychologism in logic and mathematics - Husserl argued logical laws are not psychological laws
- **builds_upon**: [[ideas/methodological-doubt|Methodological Doubt]] by [[individuals/descartes|Descartes]] - Uses epoché (bracketing) to suspend judgment about existence
- **influenced_by**: [[individuals/franz-brentano|Brentano]]'s analysis of intentionality as mark of the mental
- **responds_to**: Kantian transcendental philosophy and its limits

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/martin-heidegger|Heidegger]]'s [[ideas/dasein|Dasein]] and fundamental ontology
- **influences**: [[individuals/maurice-merleau-ponty|Merleau-Ponty]]'s embodied phenomenology and perception theory
- **influences**: [[individuals/jean-paul-sartre|Sartre]]'s existentialism and [[ideas/bad-faith|Bad Faith]]
- **influences**: [[individuals/emmanuel-levinas|Levinas]]'s ethics as first philosophy
- **influences**: [[ideas/hermeneutics|Hermeneutics]] through Heidegger's interpretive turn
- **influences**: Contemporary philosophy of mind discussions of [[ideas/intentionality|Intentionality]]

## Notes

**Husserl's Phenomenological Method:**

**Epoché (Phenomenological Reduction):**
- Bracket or suspend the "natural attitude" that assumes world's existence
- Don't deny external world, but set aside questions about its existence
- Focus purely on how things appear to consciousness
- Similar to Cartesian doubt but for methodological rather than foundational purposes

**Intentionality:**
- Consciousness is always consciousness of something
- Every mental act has directedness toward an object
- Object might not exist (unicorns, fictional characters) but intentional relation remains
- Structure: noesis (mental act) - noema (object as intended)

**Eidetic Reduction:**
- Move from particular experiences to essential structures
- Imaginative variation reveals invariant features
- Discover a priori structures of consciousness
- Essential rather than empirical psychology

**Transcendental Phenomenology:**
- Ego as transcendental subject constituting meaning
- World as phenomenon constituted by transcendental consciousness
- Genetic phenomenology: How objects are constituted in temporal flow
- Passive synthesis: Pre-predicative constitution of sense

**Continental Development:**

**Heidegger's Transformation:**
- From epistemology to fundamental ontology
- Dasein (being-there) as being-in-the-world
- Hermeneutical rather than purely descriptive method
- Temporality and finitude central to human existence

**Merleau-Ponty's Embodiment:**
- Critique of intellectualist phenomenology
- Body as primary site of world-disclosure
- Perception as bodily engagement with environment
- Phenomenology of perception grounds all higher cognition

**Sartre's Existentialist Turn:**
- Consciousness as nothingness (néant) confronting being
- Bad faith as self-deceptive denial of freedom
- Phenomenology applied to emotions, imagination, ethics

**Contemporary Relevance:**
- **Philosophy of Mind**: Detailed analysis of consciousness structure
- **Cognitive Science**: Challenge to computational theories of mind
- **Embodied Cognition**: Merleau-Ponty's insights in psychology/neuroscience
- **Qualitative Research**: Phenomenological methods in social sciences

**Key Insights:**
1. Consciousness has essential structure independent of psychological facts
2. Meaning is constituted rather than simply discovered
3. Experience has temporal structure (retention-primal impression-protention)
4. Pre-reflective experience grounds reflective thought
5. Intersubjectivity constituted through empathetic understanding

**Criticisms:**
- Difficulty of genuine epoché - can we really bracket natural attitude?
- Problem of solipsism - how to establish intersubjective validity?
- Idealistic tendencies - world as purely constituted by consciousness
- Method vs. results - unclear relation between phenomenological method and metaphysical conclusions
