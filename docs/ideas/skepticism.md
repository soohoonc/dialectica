# Skepticism

**Author**: [[individuals/pyrrho|Pyrrho]]

**Year**: -300

**Historical Period**: [[periods/hellenistic-philosophy|Hellenistic Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Epistemology, #Ethics

## Description

The philosophical position that we cannot have certain knowledge about reality, either because knowledge is impossible (academic skepticism) or because we should suspend judgment about truth claims (Pyrrhonian skepticism). Skepticism serves either to refute dogmatic claims or to achieve tranquility.

## Influenced By

- **responds_to**: Dogmatic philosophical schools making confident claims about reality
- **influenced_by**: Cultural relativism observed through travel and exposure to different customs
- **builds_upon**: Socratic acknowledgment of ignorance ("I know that I know nothing")

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/sextus-empiricus|Sextus Empiricus]]'s systematic presentation of skeptical arguments
- **influences**: [[ideas/methodological-doubt|Methodological Doubt]] by [[individuals/descartes|Descartes]] - though for foundational rather than skeptical purposes
- **influences**: [[individuals/david-hume|Hume]]'s critique of causation, induction, and rational justification
- **influences**: Contemporary epistemology through brain-in-vat scenarios and closure arguments
- **responded_to**: by [[individuals/immanuel-kant|Kant]]'s critical philosophy attempting to answer Humean skepticism

## Notes

**Ancient Skeptical Traditions:**

**Pyrrhonian Skepticism:**
- **Epoché**: Suspension of judgment about truth of propositions
- **Ataraxia**: Tranquility follows from giving up the search for truth
- **Equipollence**: For every argument, equally strong counter-argument exists
- **Ten Modes**: Systematic arguments for suspension (relativity of perception, infinite regress, etc.)

**Academic Skepticism:**
- Moderate skepticism: Probable knowledge possible, certain knowledge impossible
- **Carneades**: Nothing can be known with certainty, but some beliefs more probable than others
- Influenced by Plato's critique of sense perception

**Medieval and Modern Development:**

**Augustine's Response:**
- Skepticism self-refuting: Doubt presupposes doubter's existence
- Divine illumination provides certain knowledge
- Faith seeking understanding (fides quaerens intellectum)

**Cartesian Appropriation:**
- Methodological doubt as tool for discovering certainty
- Cogito ergo sum as skeptic-proof foundation
- Evil demon hypothesis as extreme skeptical scenario

**Humean Radicalization:**

**Problem of Induction:**
- No rational justification for believing future resembles past
- Inductive reasoning cannot be justified inductively (circular) or deductively (invalid)
- Custom and habit, not reason, guide expectations

**Causal Skepticism:**
- No necessary connection observed between cause and effect
- Only constant conjunction, not causal power
- Causal beliefs result from psychological association, not logical reasoning

**External World Skepticism:**
- All knowledge comes from impressions (sensory experiences)
- No logical inference from impressions to external objects
- Bundle theory: Self as collection of perceptions, not substantial entity

**Contemporary Skepticism:**

**Brain in Vat:**
- Modern version of Cartesian evil demon
- If you were brain in vat receiving electrical stimulation, experiences would be identical
- Therefore cannot know you're not brain in vat
- Therefore cannot know anything about external world

**Closure Principle:**
- If S knows P, and P entails Q, and S knows P entails Q, then S knows Q
- You know you have hands
- Having hands entails not being handless brain in vat
- Therefore you know you're not handless brain in vat
- But this seems false - contradiction reveals problem

**Responses to Skepticism:**

**Contextualism**: Knowledge attributions context-sensitive
**Pragmatism**: Focus on what works rather than absolute certainty
**Externalism**: Knowledge doesn't require internal access to justification
**Moorean Response**: "Here is a hand" - common sense trumps skeptical arguments
**Transcendental Arguments**: Conditions necessary for possibility of thought/experience

**Types of Skeptical Arguments:**
1. **Regress Arguments**: Infinite regress of justification
2. **Circularity**: Reasoning in circles
3. **Criterion Problem**: Need criterion for truth, but how to establish criterion?
4. **Underdetermination**: Multiple theories compatible with same evidence
5. **Error Possibilities**: Cannot rule out error scenarios
