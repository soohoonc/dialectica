# Atomism

**Author**: [[individuals/democritus|Democritus]]

**Year**: -400

**Historical Period**: [[periods/pre-socratic-philosophy|Pre-Socratic Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Metaphysics, #Natural Philosophy

## Description

The theory that reality consists of indivisible particles (atoms) moving in void space. All natural phenomena result from atomic combinations and separations according to mechanical necessity, not purpose or design.

## Influenced By

- **responds_to**: [[ideas/being-vs-becoming|Being vs Becoming]] - Atomism attempts to reconcile Parmenidean permanence (atoms) with Heraclitean change (atomic motion)
- **builds_upon**: [[individuals/leucippus|Leucippus]]'s earlier atomic theory - Democritus developed his teacher's basic insights
- **responds_to**: Eleatic problems of change and plurality by making void space real

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/epicurus|Epicurus]]'s atomic materialism - Epicurus adopted atomism for ethical purposes, adding atomic swerve for free will
- **influences**: [[individuals/lucretius|Lucretius]]'s *De Rerum Natura* - Roman poet spread Epicurean atomism through Latin literature
- **influences**: Modern scientific atomism through [[individuals/francis-bacon|Bacon]], [[individuals/robert-boyle|Boyle]], and [[individuals/john-dalton|Dalton]]
- **influences**: [[ideas/materialism|Materialism]] by [[individuals/karl-marx|Marx]] - Marx's doctoral dissertation analyzed Democritean and Epicurean atomism
- **criticized_by**: [[individuals/plato|Plato]] and [[individuals/aristotle|Aristotle]] - Both rejected atomism in favor of teleological explanations

## Notes

Democritus's atomism proposed several revolutionary ideas:

**Basic Principles:**
- Atoms are indivisible, eternal, and infinite in number and variety
- Only atoms and void exist - all else is conventional (appearance)
- All change results from atomic motion and recombination
- No final causes or purposes, only efficient (mechanical) causation

**Epistemological Implications:**
- Sensible qualities (sweet, bitter, hot, cold) exist "by convention"
- True reality consists only of atoms with mathematical properties (size, shape, position)
- Knowledge comes from atomic effluences affecting our sense organs

**Ethical Consequences:**
- No divine providence or cosmic justice
- Death is merely atomic dissolution - "nothing to us"
- Happiness depends on understanding nature's true workings

Aristotle criticized atomism for eliminating final causation and making void real. Medieval Islamic and Christian philosophers largely ignored it. The theory revived during the Scientific Revolution as mechanical philosophy displaced Aristotelian physics.

Contemporary physics has both vindicated and transcended ancient atomism. While matter does consist of fundamental particles, quantum mechanics reveals wave-particle duality and probabilistic rather than purely mechanical causation. Nonetheless, the atomist program of explaining macroscopic phenomena through microscopic interactions remains central to natural science.
