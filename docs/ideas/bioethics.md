# Bioethics

## Core Concept
Bioethics examines ethical issues arising from advances in biology, medicine, and healthcare, providing frameworks for moral decision-making in medical practice, research, and health policy.

## Historical Development

### Origins in Medical Ethics
Traditional medical ethics focused on physician duties and virtues, codified in the **Hippocratic Oath** and similar professional codes emphasizing:
- **"First, do no harm"** (primum non nocere)
- Patient confidentiality
- Professional integrity
- Paternalistic approach to patient care

### Modern Bioethics Emergence (1960s-1970s)

**Catalyzing Events**
- **Nuremberg Trials**: revelation of Nazi medical experiments
- **Tuskegee Syphilis Study**: unethical research on African Americans
- **Dialysis rationing**: scarcity forcing explicit allocation decisions
- **Transplant technology**: questions about brain death and organ procurement

**Institutional Development**
- **Hastings Center** (1969) and **Kennedy Institute of Ethics** (1971)
- Integration of philosophy, theology, law, and medicine
- Shift from professional self-regulation to public oversight

### Principlism: The Georgetown Approach

**Beauchamp and Childress Framework**
[[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[James Childress]] developed the **Four Principles** approach:

1. **Autonomy**: respecting persons' self-determination and decision-making capacity
2. **Beneficence**: acting in patients' best interests
3. **Non-maleficence**: avoiding harm ("do no harm")
4. **Justice**: fair distribution of benefits and burdens

**Principlism's Influence**
- Dominant framework in medical education and clinical practice
- Basis for many professional codes and institutional policies
- Common language for interdisciplinary ethics consultation

## Major Theoretical Approaches

### End of Life Issues

**Death and Dying**
- **Brain death vs. cardiac death**: competing definitions of death
- **Persistent vegetative state**: [[Nancy Cruzan]] and [[Terri Schiavo]] cases
- **Advance directives**: autonomous planning for incapacity
- **Quality vs. sanctity of life**: competing values in end-of-life care

**Physician-Assisted Death**

- **International experience**: Netherlands, Oregon, and other jurisdictions

**Palliative Care**
- **Dame Cicely Saunders** and hospice movement
- **Total pain**: physical, psychological, social, and spiritual suffering
- **Double effect**: intending pain relief vs. hastening death
- Integration with curative care throughout illness trajectory

### Research Ethics

**Human Subjects Protection**
- **Informed consent**: understanding, voluntariness, and competence
- **Risk-benefit assessment**: acceptable levels of research risk
- **Vulnerable populations**: children, prisoners, economically disadvantaged
- **International research**: standard of care and exploitation concerns

**Clinical Trials Design**
- **Equipoise**: genuine uncertainty about treatment effectiveness
- **Placebo controls**: when is placebo use ethically acceptable?
- **Randomization**: balancing scientific validity with patient care
- **Interim analysis**: stopping rules for beneficial or harmful effects

### Emerging Technologies

**Artificial Intelligence in Medicine**
- **Machine learning**: bias, transparency, and accountability
- **Diagnostic AI**: human oversight and medical liability
- **Algorithmic decision-making**: fairness and discrimination
- **Data ownership**: patient privacy and commercial interests

**Precision Medicine**

## Contemporary Significance
Bioethics continues to evolve in response to technological advances, social changes, and global health challenges. Its interdisciplinary character, practical focus, and public engagement make it a vital bridge between philosophical reflection and real-world decision-making in healthcare, research, and health policy. The field's emphasis on reasoned public discourse about moral issues in medicine contributes to democratic deliberation about science and technology in society.
