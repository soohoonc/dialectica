# Panpsychism

**Authors**: Various (Spinoza, Leibniz, Schopenhauer, Whitehead, Chalmers)

**Year**: 1677-present

**Historical Periods**: [[periods/early-modern-philosophy|Early Modern Philosophy]] to [[periods/contemporary-philosophy|Contemporary Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Metaphysics, #Philosophy of Mind

## Description

The view that consciousness or mind-like properties are fundamental and ubiquitous features of reality. All entities, from electrons to ecosystems, possess some form of experience or mental properties, though these may be extremely simple in basic particles.

## Influenced By

- **builds_upon**: [[ideas/substance-monism|Substance Monism]] by [[individuals/spinoza|Spinoza]] - Spinoza's dual-aspect monism implied universal mentality
- **builds_upon**: [[ideas/monadology|Monadology]] by [[individuals/gottfried-leibniz|Leibniz]] - All monads have perception and appetite
- **responds_to**: The hard problem of consciousness - How does conscious experience arise from non-conscious matter?
- **responds_to**: [[ideas/materialism|Materialism]]'s apparent inability to explain consciousness

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/arthur-schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s world as Will and Representation - Will as universal striving present in all phenomena
- **influences**: [[individuals/alfred-north-whitehead|Whitehead]]'s process philosophy - All actual entities have subjective experience
- **influences**: Contemporary philosophy of mind through [[individuals/david-chalmers|Chalmers]], [[individuals/galen-strawson|Strawson]], [[individuals/philip-goff|Goff]]
- **criticized_by**: [[individuals/daniel-dennett|Dennett]] and other eliminative materialists who deny consciousness poses special problems

## Notes

**Historical Development:**

**Early Modern Panpsychism:**
- Spinoza: God/Nature has both thought and extension as attributes
- Leibniz: All monads are perceiving substances, differing only in clarity
- Both avoid the interaction problem by making mind fundamental

**19th Century Development:**
- Schopenhauer: Will as thing-in-itself manifesting as both mind and matter
- Gustav Fechner: Psychophysics and consciousness in plants, Earth, etc.
- William Clifford: "Mind-stuff" as fundamental component of reality

**20th-21st Century Revival:**
- Whitehead: Actual entities as "occasions of experience"
- Contemporary responses to hard problem of consciousness
- Combination problem: How do micro-experiences create macro-consciousness?

**Arguments For Panpsychism:**
1. **Emergence Problem**: Consciousness seems to emerge from nowhere in materialist accounts
2. **Intrinsic Nature Argument**: Physics describes structural/relational properties; consciousness could be intrinsic nature
3. **Continuity**: Avoids sudden emergence of mind in evolutionary history
4. **Unity**: Provides coherent worldview where mind-matter distinction is perspectival

**Arguments Against:**
1. **Combination Problem**: How do micro-experiences combine into unified consciousness?
2. **Phenomenal Bonding**: What determines which experiences belong to same subject?
3. **Counterintuitive**: Attributing experience to electrons seems absurd
4. **Explanatory Impotence**: Doesn't actually solve hard problem

**Contemporary Varieties:**
- **Micropsychism**: Fundamental particles have simple experiences
- **Cosmopsychism**: Universe as single conscious entity with parts as aspects
- **Panprotopsychism**: Fundamental entities have proto-conscious properties that aren't quite experience
