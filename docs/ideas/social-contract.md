# Social Contract Theory

## Core Concept
Social contract theory explains the origin and legitimacy of political authority through hypothetical or actual agreements among individuals to form organized society, establishing the foundations for government, law, and moral obligation.

## Historical Development

### Ancient and Medieval Precursors
- [[Plato]]'s *Republic* - justice and ideal state formation
- [[Aristotle]]'s natural political community vs. contractual arrangements
- Medieval theories of consent and political obligation
- [[Thomas Aquinas]] on natural law and human association

### Classical Modern Period

**Thomas Hobbes: The Pessimistic Foundation**
[[Thomas Hobbes]]'s *Leviathan* (1651) established modern social contract theory:

**State of Nature Analysis**
- **"War of all against all"**: natural condition of conflict and competition
- **No morality or justice**: these concepts require sovereign authority
- **Life "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"**: consequences of anarchy
- **Natural equality**: everyone capable of killing anyone else
- **Scarcity and distrust**: sources of perpetual conflict

**The Social Contract**
- **Mutual agreement**: individuals surrender natural rights to sovereign
- **Authorization**: sovereign acts as representative of all subjects
- **Absolute sovereignty**: no limits on sovereign power
- **Indivisible authority**: cannot separate legislative, executive, judicial powers
- **No right of resistance**: subjects cannot legitimately rebel

**Hobbes' Logic**
1. Rational self-interest motivates contract formation
2. Security requires absolute power concentration
3. Limited government leads back to state of nature
4. Any government better than no government

### Locke's Liberal Alternative

**John Locke's Optimistic Vision**
[[John Locke]]'s *Two Treatises of Government* (1689) offered alternative social contract:

**State of Nature Reconceived**
- **Generally peaceful**: governed by natural law and reason
- **Natural rights**: life, liberty, property pre-exist government
- **Moral obligations**: natural law binding even without government
- **"Inconveniences"**: lack of impartial judge, enforcement mechanism
- **Consent-based**: obligations arise from voluntary agreement

**Limited Government Contract**
- **Consent of the governed**: legitimate authority requires consent
- **Separation of powers**: legislative, executive, federative functions
- **Right of resistance**: people may overthrow tyrannical government
- **Property protection**: primary purpose of government
- **Majority rule**: within constitutional constraints

**Locke vs. Hobbes Comparison**
- **Human nature**: Locke more optimistic about natural sociability
- **Natural law**: Locke affirms, Hobbes denies pre-political morality
- **Government limits**: Locke constitutional, Hobbes absolute
- **Resistance**: Locke permits, Hobbes forbids
- **Property**: Locke natural right, Hobbes sovereign creation

### Rousseau's Democratic Innovation

**Jean-Jacques Rousseau's General Will**
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s *Social Contract* (1762) transformed contract theory:

**The Problem of Legitimate Authority**
- **"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains"**: puzzle of political obligation
- **Force vs. right**: mere power cannot create legitimate obligation
- **Natural freedom vs. civil liberty**: what justifies the trade-off?

**Rousseau's Solution: General Will**
- **Total alienation**: each individual surrenders all rights to community
- **General will**: collective will aimed at common good
- **Popular sovereignty**: people as both sovereign and subject
- **Moral freedom**: obedience to laws we give ourselves
- **Civil religion**: shared values necessary for social unity

**Distinctive Features**
- **Democratic participation**: direct self-government rather than representation
- **Moral transformation**: contract changes human nature itself
- **Equality principle**: artificial inequalities must be justified
- **Common good**: particular wills must submit to general will

**Three Contracts Compared**

| Aspect | Hobbes | Locke | Rousseau |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| State of Nature | War, brutish | Peaceful, inconvenient | Natural goodness, inequality develops |
| Human Nature | Selfish, competitive | Rational, social | Naturally good, corrupted by society |
| Contract Purpose | Security, order | Protect rights, property | Moral freedom, equality |
| Government Type | Absolute sovereignty | Limited constitutional | Direct democracy |
| Individual Rights | Surrendered completely | Retained, inalienable | Transformed into civil rights |
| Resistance Right | No | Yes, against tyranny | Yes, through democratic process |

## Contemporary Developments

### Rawlsian Revival

**John Rawls' Original Position**
[[John Rawls]] revived social contract theory in *A Theory of Justice* (1971):

**Methodological Innovation**
- **[[Veil of Ignorance]]**: hypothetical choice situation
- **Original position**: fair conditions for choosing principles of justice
- **Reflective equilibrium**: balancing principles and considered judgments
- **Pure procedural justice**: justice as outcome of fair procedure

**Two Principles of Justice**
1. **Equal basic liberties**: maximum liberty compatible with equal liberty for all
2. **Difference principle**: inequalities justified only if they benefit worst-off

**Contractual Justification**
- Rational agents behind veil of ignorance would choose these principles
- Justice as fairness: principles chosen under fair conditions
- Political not metaphysical: overlapping consensus among reasonable doctrines

### Contemporary Contractarianism

**David Gauthier's Rational Choice Approach**
[[David Gauthier]] develops contractarianism from rational choice theory:
- **Morals by agreement**: morality emerges from rational bargaining
- **Constrained maximization**: rational to accept moral constraints
- **Bargaining theory**: Nash equilibrium solutions to social cooperation
- **Individual rationality**: no appeal to altruism or moral sentiment

**Jan Narveson's Libertarian Contractarianism**
- Contract justifies minimal state only
- No redistribution without consent
- Individual rights as side-constraints on social cooperation
- Challenge to Rawlsian difference principle

### Feminist Critiques and Alternatives

**Carole Pateman's Sexual Contract**
[[Carole Pateman]] reveals gendered assumptions in contract theory:
- **Sexual contract**: patriarchal domination underlying social contract
- **Public/private distinction**: women excluded from original social contract
- **Marriage contract**: women's subordination through "voluntary" agreement
- **Critique of consent**: structural inequalities undermine genuine consent

**Susan Moller Okin's Feminist Justice**
[[Susan Moller Okin]] applies Rawlsian method to gender:
- Behind veil of ignorance, no knowledge of sex/gender
- Would choose principles ensuring gender equality
- Family as basic structure of society requiring justice principles
- Critique of traditional contract theory's male-centered assumptions

### Multicultural and Global Extensions

**Will Kymlicka's Multicultural Citizenship**
- Contract theory and minority rights
- Cultural membership as primary good
- Group rights vs. individual rights in liberal theory
- Accommodation of cultural diversity within contractarian framework

**Charles Beitz's Global Justice**
- Extension of Rawlsian approach to international relations
- Global original position and international difference principle
- Critique of state-centric approaches to justice
- Cosmopolitan vs. communitarian approaches to global contract

## Philosophical Debates

### Consent and Legitimacy

**Actual vs. Hypothetical Consent**
- **Locke's problem**: most people never actually consented to government
- **Tacit consent**: remaining in territory implies consent
- **Hypothetical consent**: what rational people would agree to
- **[[Robert Paul Wolff]]'s anarchist critique**: no consent without actual agreement

**Democratic Participation**
- **[[Robert Dahl]]'s democratic theory**: ongoing consent through participation
- **[[Benjamin Barber]]'s strong democracy**: participatory vs. representative democracy
- Tension between consent and practical governance needs

### State of Nature Debates

**Empirical Questions**
- **Anthropological evidence**: what were pre-political societies actually like?
- **[[Steven Pinker]]'s violence data**: declining violence with state formation
- **[[James C. Scott]]'s critique**: "against the grain" of state formation
- Relevance of historical accuracy to normative theory

**Methodological Questions**
- **[[Jean Hampton]]'s analysis**: state of nature as analytical device
- Hypothetical vs. historical interpretation
- Role of thought experiments in political philosophy

### Communitarian Critiques

**[[Michael Sandel]]'s Critique of the Unencumbered Self**
- Contractarian individuals too abstract and atomistic
- Moral identity partially constituted by community membership
- Justice cannot be primary virtue if community membership is constitutive
- Need for shared values and common good beyond individual rights

**[[Alasdair MacIntyre]]'s Tradition-Based Critique**
- Contractarian approach assumes culturally specific liberal values
- Justice requires shared narrative and tradition
- Individual rights discourse undermines social solidarity
- Need for virtue-based rather than contract-based ethics

**[[Charles Taylor]]'s Critique of Atomism**
- Humans are fundamentally social beings
- Language, culture, identity are irreducibly social
- Contract theory presupposes what it seeks to explain
- Dialogical self requires recognition from others

## Contemporary Applications

### Constitutional Design
- **[[Bruce Ackerman]]'s constitutional moments**: extraordinary vs. normal politics
- **[[Jon Elster]]'s constitutional conventions**: rational choice and institutional design
- Separation of powers, federalism, judicial review as contractual solutions
- Amendment procedures and intergenerational consent

### International Relations
- **[[John Rawls]]' Law of Peoples**: international original position
- **Cosmopolitan democracy**: global social contract
- **[[Thomas Pogge]]'s global justice**: international difference principle
- Climate change as global collective action problem

### Business Ethics
- **[[Thomas Dunfee]] and [[Thomas Donaldson]]'s integrative social contracts theory**
- Corporate social responsibility as implicit contract
- Stakeholder theory and fiduciary duties
- Professional codes as guild contracts

### Bioethics and Research Ethics
- Informed consent as micro-contract
- Research subject protection through contractual safeguards
- Professional-patient relationships as fiduciary contracts
- Public participation in research priority setting

## Criticisms and Responses

### Anarchist Critiques
**[[Robert Paul Wolff]]'s Challenge**
- **Moral autonomy**: duty to act only on self-legislated principles
- **Political authority**: right to command and correlative duty to obey
- **Contradiction**: cannot maintain both autonomy and submit to authority
- **Response**: Democratic participation as self-legislation

### Feminist Critiques
**Exclusion and Domination**
- Women historically excluded from social contract
- Private sphere exempted from justice principles
- **Response**: Extension of contract principles to all social relationships

### Communitarian Critiques
**Atomistic Individualism**
- Contract theory assumes pre-social individuals
- Neglects constitutive community attachments
- **Response**: Political not metaphysical conception of persons

### Postcolonial Critiques
**Cultural Imperialism**
- Contract theory reflects Western individualistic values
- Imposed on societies with different organizational principles
- **Response**: Overlapping consensus across cultures

## Connections to Other Ideas
- **[[Natural Rights]]**: Foundation for Lockean contractarianism
- **[[Democratic Theory]]**: Rousseauian self-government ideals
- **[[Justice Theory]]**: Rawlsian contractual approach to distributive justice
- **[[Libertarianism]]**: Minimal state justified through contract
- **[[Communitarianism]]**: Critique of contractarian individualism
- **[[Feminist Political Theory]]**: Gender analysis of contract assumptions

## Contemporary Significance
Social contract theory remains influential in political philosophy, constitutional law, and public policy. Its emphasis on consent, legitimacy, and rational justification continues to shape debates about democratic governance, individual rights, and political obligation. Contemporary versions address global justice, environmental cooperation, and technological governance, demonstrating the framework's continued relevance for understanding political authority and social cooperation in diverse contexts.
