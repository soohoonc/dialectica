# Linguistic Turn

## Core Concept
The linguistic turn refers to the fundamental shift in 20th-century philosophy toward analyzing language as the key to understanding philosophical problems, emphasizing that many traditional philosophical issues stem from linguistic confusion and can be resolved through careful attention to how language works.

## Historical Development

### Precursors and Early Influences

**Gottlob Frege's Logical Analysis**
[[Gottlob Frege]] laid groundwork for language-focused philosophy:
- **Sense and reference**: distinction between meaning and what expressions refer to
- **Compositional semantics**: meaning of complex expressions from parts
- **Logical form**: underlying structure beneath grammatical appearance
- **Context principle**: words have meaning only in context of sentences

**Bertrand Russell's Logical Atomism**
[[Bertrand Russell]] developed systematic approach to language and reality:
- **Theory of descriptions**: analyzing definite descriptions logically
- **Logical form vs. grammatical form**: surface grammar misleads about logical structure
- **Atomic facts**: simple constituents of reality corresponding to atomic propositions
- **Principia Mathematica**: reducing mathematics to logic through formal language

### Early Wittgenstein: Picture Theory

**Tractus Logico-Philosophicus (1921)**
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early work provided influential theory of language:

**Picture Theory of Language**
- **Language as picture**: propositions picture possible states of affairs
- **Logical form**: shared structure between language and reality
- **Elementary propositions**: simple pictures of atomic facts
- **Truth conditions**: propositions true when they match reality

**Limits of Language**
- **What can be said**: factual propositions with clear sense
- **What cannot be said**: ethics, aesthetics, metaphysics beyond language
- **Mystical**: what shows itself but cannot be said
- **\"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent\"**

**Influence on Logical Positivism**
- **Vienna Circle**: Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, Otto Neurath
- **Verification principle**: meaning tied to verification conditions
- **Unity of science**: all meaningful statements reducible to observational language
- **Elimination of metaphysics**: metaphysical statements as meaningless

### Ordinary Language Philosophy

**J.L. Austin's Speech Act Theory**
[[J.L. Austin]]'s *How to Do Things with Words* revolutionized language philosophy:

**Performative Utterances**
- **Constatives vs. performatives**: statements vs. actions performed by speaking
- **\"I do\"**: marriage vows as example of performative speech
- **Felicity conditions**: conditions for successful performance of speech acts
- **Failure modes**: ways speech acts can go wrong

**Speech Act Theory**
- **Locutionary act**: saying something with meaning
- **Illocutionary act**: doing something in saying (promising, commanding)
- **Perlocutionary act**: achieving effects through saying
- **Force vs. content**: what we do vs. what we say

**Gilbert Ryle's Category Mistakes**
[[Gilbert Ryle]]'s *The Concept of Mind* attacked Cartesian dualism:
- **Category mistake**: treating concepts from one category as belonging to another
- **Ghost in the machine**: critique of mind as separate substance
- **Ordinary language**: philosophical problems as linguistic confusions
- **Thick descriptions**: understanding behavior in context

### Later Wittgenstein: Language Games

**Philosophical Investigations (1953)**
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy transformed understanding of language:

**Critique of Picture Theory**
- **Augustine's picture**: primitive theory of language as naming
- **Use theory of meaning**: meaning as use in language games
- **Family resemblance**: concepts connected by overlapping similarities
- **No essence**: no single feature defining all uses of concept

**[[Language Games]]**
- **Forms of life**: language embedded in activities and practices
- **Rule-following**: understanding rules through participation in practices
- **Private language impossibility**: no purely private meaningful language
- **Grammar**: rules for language use, not empirical descriptions

**Therapeutic Philosophy**
- **Language on holiday**: philosophical problems from misusing language
- **Ordinary language**: return to everyday uses resolves confusions
- **Dissolving problems**: showing problems rest on linguistic mistakes
- **\"Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language\"**

### Oxford Ordinary Language Philosophy

**John Langshaw Austin's Development**
Beyond speech acts, Austin developed systematic ordinary language approach:
- **Linguistic phenomenology**: careful attention to ordinary usage
- **\"Ifs and cans\"**: analysis of conditional and modal expressions
- **Excuses**: examining concepts through study of excuses and justifications
- **Precision**: ordinary language more nuanced than philosophical technical language

**Paul Grice's Conversational Implicature**
[[Paul Grice]] analyzed how meaning works in conversation:
- **Speaker meaning**: what speaker intends to communicate
- **Conversational maxims**: quantity, quality, relation, manner
- **Implicature**: what is implied beyond literal meaning
- **Cooperative principle**: assumption of cooperation in conversation

**Peter Strawson's Descriptive Metaphysics**
[[P.F. Strawson]] developed systematic approach to conceptual analysis:
- **Descriptive vs. revisionary metaphysics**: mapping vs. changing conceptual schemes
- **Persons**: primitive concept not reducible to mental or physical
- **Reference and presupposition**: referring expressions and existence assumptions
- **Reactive attitudes**: moral responsibility grounded in participant attitudes

## Varieties of Linguistic Philosophy

### Logical Analysis Tradition

**Rudolf Carnap's Formal Semantics**
- **Logical syntax**: formal study of linguistic forms
- **Protocol sentences**: basic observational statements
- **Tolerance principle**: freedom in choosing linguistic frameworks
- **Explication**: replacing inexact concepts with precise formal counterparts

**W.V.O. Quine's Holism**
[[W.V.O. Quine]] challenged sharp distinctions in logical empiricism:
- **\"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\"**: critique of analytic-synthetic distinction
- **Holism**: beliefs face tribunal of experience as corporate body
- **Ontological relativity**: what exists relative to linguistic framework
- **Indeterminacy of translation**: no fact of matter about meaning

**Donald Davidson's Truth-Conditional Semantics**
[[Donald Davidson]] developed systematic semantic theory:
- **Tarski-style truth theories**: recursive definition of truth for natural language
- **Principle of charity**: interpreting others as mostly rational and correct
- **Radical interpretation**: understanding meaning and belief simultaneously
- **Anomalous monism**: mental events without psychophysical laws

### Continental Approaches

**Martin Heidegger's Language Philosophy**
[[Martin Heidegger]] developed hermeneutic approach to language:
- **Language as house of being**: language reveals and conceals Being
- **Poetic thinking**: authentic language vs. calculative technical language
- **Etymology**: returning to original meanings of philosophical terms
- **\"Language speaks\"**: language as active revealer rather than human tool

**Hans-Georg Gadamer's Hermeneutics**
[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] developed philosophical hermeneutics:
- **Understanding as dialogue**: fusion of horizons between interpreter and text
- **Effective history**: how tradition shapes understanding
- **Language as medium**: all understanding linguistically mediated
- **Play**: understanding as participatory activity

**Jacques Derrida's Deconstruction**
[[Jacques Derrida]] developed critique of Western metaphysics through language:
- **Différance**: difference and deferral in linguistic meaning
- **Binary oppositions**: hierarchical pairs structuring Western thought
- **Logocentrism**: privilege of speech over writing, presence over absence
- **[[Deconstruction]]**: revealing instability of conceptual foundations

## Major Debates and Developments

### Analytic vs. Continental Divide

**Different Approaches to Language**
- **Analytic**: formal, logical, scientific approach to language
- **Continental**: hermeneutic, historical, literary approach to language
- **Common concern**: centrality of language to philosophical understanding
- **Different methods**: logical analysis vs. interpretive understanding

**Richard Rorty's Mediation**
[[Richard Rorty]] attempted to bridge analytic-continental divide:
- **Pragmatist approach**: language as tool rather than mirror of reality
- **Critique of representationalism**: abandoning correspondence theory of truth
- **Conversation**: philosophy as ongoing cultural conversation
- **Post-philosophical culture**: moving beyond traditional philosophical problems

### Chomsky Revolution

**Noam Chomsky's Linguistic Theory**
[[Noam Chomsky]] transformed understanding of language:
- **Generative grammar**: finite rules generating infinite linguistic expressions
- **Universal grammar**: innate linguistic capacity shared by all humans
- **Competence vs. performance**: idealized knowledge vs. actual usage
- **Critique of behaviorism**: language learning cannot be explained by conditioning

**Implications for Philosophy**
- **Innateness**: challenges empiricist theories of concept acquisition
- **Rationalism**: revival of rationalist approaches to mind and knowledge
- **Modularity**: mind as collection of specialized cognitive modules
- **Naturalization**: studying language scientifically rather than conceptually

### Kripke's Semantic Externalism

**Saul Kripke's Naming and Necessity**
[[Saul Kripke]] revolutionized philosophical semantics:
- **Rigid designation**: proper names refer to same individual across possible worlds
- **Causal theory of reference**: reference established through causal chains
- **Necessary a posteriori**: necessary truths discovered empirically
- **Identity statements**: necessary if true between rigid designators

**Hilary Putnam's Twin Earth**
[[Hilary Putnam]] extended externalist arguments:
- **Natural kind terms**: meaning depends on environment, not internal mental states
- **Division of linguistic labor**: experts determine reference for technical terms
- **\"Meaning just ain't in the head\"**: semantic externalism about content
- **Social character**: meaning as social rather than individual phenomenon

### Private Language Debate

**Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument**
- **Impossibility**: no language referring to private sensations only speaker knows
- **Rule-following**: no private criteria for correct rule application
- **Beetle in box**: privacy irrelevant to language meaning
- **Community practice**: language as essentially public and social

**Responses and Interpretations**
- **Malcolm interpretation**: private mental language impossible
- **Kripke interpretation**: rule-following skepticism and community solution
- **Baker-Hacker interpretation**: grammatical investigation, not skeptical argument
- **Contemporary relevance**: consciousness, mental content, and externalism

## Contemporary Developments

### Philosophy of Language Today

**Direct Reference Theory**
- **Millian semantics**: names contribute only their referents to propositions
- **Demonstratives**: context-dependent expressions and utterance context
- **Structured propositions**: propositions with internal logical structure
- **Singular thoughts**: thoughts about particular objects

**Contextualism**
- **Semantic vs. pragmatic**: what is said vs. what is communicated
- **Context sensitivity**: widespread context dependence in natural language
- **Minimal semantics**: very thin semantic content
- **Speech act pluralism**: multiple speech acts performed by single utterance

**Experimental Philosophy of Language**
- **Empirical methods**: using psychology experiments to test philosophical theories
- **Reference intuitions**: testing theories about how reference works
- **Cultural variation**: cross-cultural differences in linguistic intuitions
- **Expertise effects**: philosophers vs. non-philosophers on semantic questions

### Cognitive Science and Language

**Embodied Cognition**
- **Conceptual metaphor**: [[George Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson]]'s theory
- **Image schemas**: basic patterns of embodied experience
- **Meaning as use**: concepts grounded in bodily experience and social interaction
- **Critique of objectivism**: meanings not objective features of world

**Computational Approaches**
- **Natural language processing**: computer understanding of human language
- **Machine translation**: challenges revealing complexity of meaning
- **Large language models**: AI systems processing and generating text
- **Philosophical implications**: what these systems reveal about meaning and understanding

### Social Epistemology and Language

**Testimony and Communication**
- **Social transmission**: most knowledge comes through testimony
- **Trust and authority**: when to believe others' reports
- **Epistemic injustice**: credibility deficits based on social identity
- **Hermeneutical injustice**: lack of concepts to articulate experience

**[[Miranda Fricker]]'s Epistemic Injustice**
- **Testimonial injustice**: credibility deficit due to negative stereotype
- **Hermeneutical injustice**: marginalized groups lack interpretive resources
- **Epistemic virtue**: intellectual virtues in testimonial exchanges
- **Social power**: how power relations affect epistemic practices

## Critiques and Limitations

### Critiques of Linguistic Turn

**Metaphysical Realism Response**
- **Mind-independence**: reality exists independently of language and conceptual schemes
- **Correspondence theory**: truth as correspondence to reality, not linguistic coherence
- **Scientific realism**: science discovers language-independent structure of reality
- **Universal grammar**: linguistic structures reflect cognitive rather than metaphysical features

**Phenomenological Critique**
- **Pre-linguistic experience**: conscious experience prior to linguistic articulation
- **Lived body**: embodied experience not fully captured by linguistic analysis
- **Temporal structure**: consciousness has temporal structure not reducible to language
- **Intersubjectivity**: shared experience foundation for language, not product

**Pragmatist Development**
- **Richard Rorty**: language as tool for coping rather than representing
- **Hilary Putnam**: internal realism avoiding metaphysical realism and relativism
- **John McDowell**: reconciling mind and world through conceptual capacities
- **Robert Brandom**: inferentialism and social pragmatics

### Post-Linguistic Turn Philosophy

**Return to Metaphysics**
- **Kit Fine**: essence and metaphysical grounding
- **Ted Sider**: metaphysical structure and natural properties
- **Karen Bennett**: building relations and levels of reality
- **Revival**: metaphysics as legitimate philosophical enterprise

**Philosophy of Mind Independence**
- **Consciousness studies**: first-person experience and phenomenology
- **Cognitive science**: empirical study of mind independent of linguistic analysis
- **Neurophilosophy**: brain science informing philosophical questions
- **Embodied cognition**: bodily basis of thought and meaning

## Connections to Other Ideas
- **[[Language Games]]**: Wittgenstein's concept of embedded linguistic practices
- **[[Speech Acts]]**: Austin's theory of performative utterances
- **[[Ordinary Language Philosophy]]**: Therapeutic approach to philosophical problems
- **[[Logical Positivism]]**: Scientific approach to meaning and verification

## Contemporary Significance
The linguistic turn fundamentally changed philosophical methodology, making careful attention to language central to philosophical investigation. Its influence extends beyond philosophy to linguistics, cognitive science, literary theory, and artificial intelligence. Contemporary developments in computational linguistics, experimental philosophy, and cognitive science continue to raise questions about the relationship between language, thought, and reality that emerged from the linguistic turn. The movement's emphasis on language as social practice rather than private mental phenomenon continues to influence debates about meaning, communication, and social epistemology.
