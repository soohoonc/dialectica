# Universals

**Author**: [[individuals/plato|Plato]]

**Year**: -380

**Historical Period**: [[periods/ancient-philosophy|Ancient Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Metaphysics, #Logic

## Description

The philosophical doctrine that general properties, relations, and kinds (universals) exist as mind-independent entities. Properties like "redness" or "triangularity" are not merely concepts or words but real features of reality shared by multiple particular things.

## Influenced By

- **builds_upon**: [[ideas/being-vs-becoming|Being vs Becoming]] - Plato's Forms provide Parmenidean permanence for universal properties
- **responds_to**: Heraclitean flux by grounding stable knowledge in eternal universals
- **influenced_by**: Pythagorean emphasis on mathematical relationships as fundamental reality

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/aristotle|Aristotle]]'s modified realism about universals as immanent in particulars
- **influences**: Medieval scholastic debates about universals in [[individuals/thomas-aquinas|Aquinas]], [[individuals/duns-scotus|Scotus]]
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/nominalism|Nominalism]] by [[individuals/william-of-ockham|Ockham]] - universals as mere names
- **influences**: Contemporary philosophy of science and discussions of natural kinds, laws of nature

## Notes

**Platonic Theory of Forms:**
- Universals exist in separate realm of Forms
- Particulars "participate" in or "imitate" Forms
- Forms are perfect, eternal, unchanging archetypes
- Knowledge of Forms through rational insight, not sensory experience

**The Problem of Universals:**
How can multiple things share properties? Three main solutions:
1. **Realism**: Universals exist independently (Platonic or Aristotelian)
2. **Nominalism**: Only names/concepts exist, no real universals
3. **Conceptualism**: Universals exist as mental concepts

**Arguments for Universals:**
1. **One Over Many**: Multiple red things share real redness
2. **Predication**: "a is F" requires F to exist as universal property
3. **Natural Kinds**: Science discovers objective similarities (gold, electrons)
4. **Laws of Nature**: Scientific laws govern types of things/properties
5. **Mathematics**: Numbers and geometrical objects seem universal

**Aristotelian Modification:**
- Universals exist in particulars, not separate realm
- Forms are immanent, not transcendent
- Substantial forms make things the kinds they are
- Avoids Plato's participation problem but faces instantiation issues

**Contemporary Debates:**
- **Armstrong**: Universals as truthmakers for property attributions
- **Lewis**: Modal realism - universals as sets of possible objects
- **Trope Theory**: Properties as particular property-instances
- **Natural Kind Essentialism**: Species and chemical elements have essential universal natures

**Challenges:**
- **Bradley's Regress**: If universals relate to particulars via relations, those relations need further relations ad infinitum
- **Location**: How can universals be wholly present in multiple locations?
- **Uninstantiated Universals**: Do uninstantiated properties (like perfect circles) exist?
- **Alien Properties**: Do universals exist for properties no actual things possess?

The universals debate connects to fundamental questions about the nature of properties, scientific realism, mathematical objects, and the metaphysics underlying predication and natural laws.
