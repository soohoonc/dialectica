# Vitalism

**Authors**: Various (Van Helmont, Stahl, Barthez, Bergson)

**Year**: 1650-1907

**Historical Period**: [[periods/early-modern-philosophy|Early Modern Philosophy]] to [[periods/modern-philosophy|Modern Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Metaphysics, #Philosophy of Science

## Description

The doctrine that living organisms possess a non-material vital force or principle that distinguishes them from non-living matter. This "élan vital" or life force cannot be reduced to purely mechanical or chemical processes.

## Influenced By

- **responds_to**: Mechanistic philosophy's reduction of organisms to machines
- **builds_upon**: Aristotelian notion of substantial forms and final causation
- **responds_to**: [[ideas/atomism|Atomism]] - Vitalists argued that life cannot emerge from mere atomic motion

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/arthur-schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s Will as the thing-in-itself driving all phenomena
- **influences**: [[individuals/friedrich-nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s [[ideas/will-to-power|Will to Power]] as the fundamental drive in nature
- **influences**: [[individuals/henri-bergson|Bergson]]'s creative evolution and critique of mechanistic Darwinism
- **criticized_by**: Modern molecular biology and biochemistry showing life's reducibility to chemistry
- **influences**: Contemporary emergence theories and philosophy of biology debates

## Notes

Vitalism developed in response to mechanical philosophy's apparent inability to explain life phenomena:

**Early Vitalism (17th-18th centuries):**
- [[individuals/jan-van-helmont|Van Helmont]]: *Archeus* as vital principle governing bodily functions
- [[individuals/georg-stahl|Stahl]]: *Anima* (soul) directing physiological processes
- [[individuals/paul-barthez|Barthez]]: *Vital principle* distinct from both mind and matter

**Arguments for Vitalism:**
- Living organisms exhibit purposive behavior not found in machines
- Self-organization, reproduction, and adaptation require non-mechanical explanation
- Chemical analysis cannot capture life's dynamic, holistic properties
- Irreducibility of biological phenomena to physics and chemistry

**Bergson's Creative Evolution (1907):**
- *Élan vital* as creative impulse driving evolution
- Life as duration and becoming, not mechanical repetition
- Intelligence and instinct as complementary vital manifestations
- Critique of both mechanistic materialism and finalist teleology

**Scientific Challenges:**
- Friedrich Wöhler's 1828 synthesis of urea from inorganic compounds
- Discovery of cellular basis of life
- Molecular biology's explanation of inheritance and metabolism
- Biochemistry showing enzyme action follows chemical laws

**Contemporary Relevance:**
- Emergence theories in philosophy of biology
- Debates about reduction vs. autonomy of biological sciences
- Systems biology and complexity theory
- Questions about consciousness and life in artificial intelligence

While scientific vitalism was largely abandoned by the 20th century, philosophical questions about biological autonomy and emergence remain active. Some philosophers argue that life exhibits genuine novelty irreducible to physics, while others maintain that apparent vitalistic phenomena will ultimately receive mechanistic explanations.
