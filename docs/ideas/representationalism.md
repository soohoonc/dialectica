# Representationalism

**Author**: [[individuals/john-locke|Locke]]

**Year**: 1689

**Historical Period**: [[periods/early-modern-philosophy|Early Modern Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Epistemology, #Philosophy of Mind

## Description

The theory that in perception and thought we are directly aware of mental representations (ideas, sense-data, mental images) rather than external objects themselves. External objects are known only indirectly through their effects on our mental representations.

## Influenced By

- **builds_upon**: Cartesian distinction between mind and external world
- **influenced_by**: Mechanistic science showing causal mediation in perception
- **responds_to**: Need to explain perceptual error and illusion
- **builds_upon**: Empiricist emphasis on ideas as building blocks of knowledge

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/george-berkeley|Berkeley]]'s [[ideas/immaterialism|Immaterialism]] - if we only know ideas, why posit matter?
- **influences**: [[individuals/david-hume|Hume]]'s skepticism about external world and causation
- **influences**: [[ideas/sense-data|Sense-Data Theory]] in early 20th-century philosophy
- **influences**: Contemporary computational theories of mind and mental representation
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/direct-realism|Direct Realism]] arguing for immediate perception of objects

## Notes

**Lockean Representationalism:**

**The Way of Ideas:**
- Mind immediately perceives only its own ideas
- Ideas as mental objects representing external world
- External objects cause ideas through causal chains
- Knowledge of external world inferential, based on ideas

**Primary vs Secondary Qualities:**
- **Primary Qualities**: Size, shape, motion, number - resemble properties in objects
- **Secondary Qualities**: Color, taste, sound, smell - powers to produce sensations, don't resemble objective properties
- Ideas of primary qualities represent objective features
- Ideas of secondary qualities merely effects of objective powers

**The Veil of Perception Problem:**
If we only directly perceive ideas, how can we know:
1. Whether external objects exist?
2. What properties they actually have?
3. Whether our ideas accurately represent them?

**Berkeley's Idealist Response:**
- If we only know ideas, why postulate unknown material substance?
- "Esse est percipi" - being is being perceived
- God as permanent perceiver ensuring consistency of experience
- Eliminates veil of perception by eliminating matter

**Humean Skeptical Consequences:**
- No rational inference from ideas to external causes
- Constant conjunction ≠ necessary connection
- External world belief based on habit, not reason
- Bundle theory: Self also mere collection of ideas

**Modern Developments:**

**Sense-Data Theory (Moore, Russell, Price):**
- Sense-data as immediate objects of perceptual awareness
- Incorrigible knowledge of sense-data vs fallible knowledge of objects
- Phenomenological analysis of perceptual experience
- Attempted solution to argument from illusion

**Contemporary Representationalism:**
- Mental representations as computational data structures
- Content of mental states determines their identity
- Intentionality explained through representation
- Functionalist approach to mind

**Arguments For Representationalism:**

1. **Argument from Illusion**: Perceptual errors show we perceive representations
2. **Causal Argument**: Science reveals causal mediation in perception
3. **Phenomenological Argument**: Introspection reveals mental images/contents
4. **Time-Lag Argument**: We see distant objects as they were, not as they are
5. **Hallucination Argument**: Subjectively identical to veridical perception

**Arguments Against Representationalism:**

1. **Veil of Perception**: Creates skeptical problem about external world
2. **Infinite Regress**: If perceiving representations requires perception, what perceives representations?
3. **Phenomenological Objection**: Doesn't match experience of perceiving objects
4. **Homunculus Problem**: Who or what observes internal representations?
5. **Transparency**: In perception, we "see through" experience to objects

**Contemporary Debates:**

**Intentionalism vs Qualia Theory:**
- Intentionalists: Conscious experience exhausted by representational content
- Qualia theorists: Conscious experience has intrinsic qualitative properties
- Role of inverted spectra and absent qualia arguments

**Narrow vs Wide Content:**
- Narrow content: Independent of external environment
- Wide content: Partly constituted by external environment
- Twin Earth arguments and externalism about mental content

**Conceptual vs Non-conceptual Content:**
- Do perceptual representations require concepts?
- Content available to subjects lacking relevant concepts?
- Interface between perception and cognition

**Neural Representationalism:**
- Neural states as vehicles of representation
- Population codes and distributed representation
- Problems of misrepresentation and underrepresentation
