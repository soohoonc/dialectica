# Direct Realism

**Authors**: Various (Reid, Austin, Gibson, McDowell, Putnam)

**Year**: 1764-present

**Historical Periods**: [[periods/enlightenment|Enlightenment]] to [[periods/contemporary-philosophy|Contemporary Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Epistemology, #Philosophy of Mind

## Description

The theory that in perception we are directly acquainted with external objects themselves, not with mental representations or sense-data. We perceive mind-independent objects immediately, without inferential mediation through mental intermediaries.

## Influenced By

- **responds_to**: [[ideas/representationalism|Representationalism]] and the problems of the "veil of perception"
- **responds_to**: [[ideas/skepticism|Skepticism]] about external world arising from representational theories
- **builds_upon**: Common-sense conviction that we perceive external objects directly
- **influenced_by**: [[individuals/thomas-reid|Reid]]'s critique of the "way of ideas"

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/j-l-austin|Austin]]'s ordinary language critique of sense-data theory
- **influences**: [[individuals/james-j-gibson|Gibson]]'s ecological psychology and direct perception
- **influences**: [[individuals/john-mcdowell|McDowell]]'s disjunctivist theory of perception
- **influences**: [[individuals/hilary-putnam|Putnam]]'s direct realism about natural kinds
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/representationalism|Representationalism]] citing perceptual illusions and scientific account of perception

## Notes

**Historical Development:**

**Reid's Common Sense Philosophy:**
- Critique of Locke/Berkeley/Hume's "way of ideas"
- No veil of ideas between mind and world
- Perception involves direct acquaintance with external objects
- Common sense principles as basis for philosophy
- Natural signs directly indicate external objects

**The Argument from Illusion Challenge:**
1. In illusions, we perceive something that doesn't exist externally
2. Phenomenologically, illusions indistinguishable from veridical perception
3. Therefore, even in veridical cases we perceive mental objects (sense-data)
4. Therefore, we never directly perceive external objects

**Direct Realist Responses:**

**Adverbial Theory (Chisholm):**
- Don't perceive sense-data; perceive adverbially
- "Sensing redly" rather than "sensing red sense-datum"
- Eliminates mental objects while preserving phenomenology
- Problems: Complex adverbs, many-property problem

**Disjunctive Theory (McDowell, Hinton):**
- Veridical perception fundamentally different from illusion/hallucination
- In veridical cases: directly perceive external objects
- In illusory cases: merely seems as if perceiving external objects
- No common factor between veridical and non-veridical cases

**Contemporary Versions:**

**Ecological Direct Realism (Gibson):**
- Perceive affordances (opportunities for action) directly
- No need for mental representations or computational processing
- Environment structured to provide information for perception
- Direct pickup of invariant information in optic array

**Intentional Direct Realism:**
- Perception is intentional state directed at external objects
- Content of perception includes external objects, not representations
- Objects are constituents of perceptual content
- Explains both directness and possibility of misrepresentation

**Relational Direct Realism:**
- Perception as conscious relation to external objects
- In veridical perception: conscious relation to actual object
- In hallucination: no genuine perceptual relation exists
- Consciousness essentially relational, not intrinsic

**Arguments For Direct Realism:**

1. **Phenomenological Argument**: Seems like we perceive objects directly
2. **Skepticism Argument**: Representationalism leads to external world skepticism
3. **Simplicity**: Avoids mysterious veil of perception
4. **Action**: Successful action requires direct contact with environment
5. **Common Sense**: Ordinary experience supports direct realism

**Arguments Against Direct Realism:**

1. **Argument from Illusion**: Perceptual errors show we perceive representations
2. **Causal Argument**: Science shows perception mediated by causal chains
3. **Time-Gap Argument**: We see distant stars as they were, not as they are
4. **Hallucination**: Subjectively indistinguishable from veridical perception
5. **Relativity of Perception**: Same object appears differently to different observers

**Contemporary Debates:**

**Disjunctivism vs Common Factor Theory:**
- Does perception have common phenomenological core?
- Are hallucinations and veridical perceptions fundamentally different?
- Implications for cognitive science and philosophy of mind

**Naive vs Sophisticated Direct Realism:**
- Naive: Perceive all manifest properties directly
- Sophisticated: Perceive some properties directly, others dispositionally
- Role of scientific account of color, sound, etc.

**High-Level Properties:**
- Do we directly perceive semantic properties (words, faces, expressions)?
- Theory-ladenness of perception
- Cognitive penetrability of perceptual experience
