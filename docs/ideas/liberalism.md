## Historical Development

### Classical Liberalism (17th-19th Century)

**John Locke: Foundational Liberal Theory**
[[John Locke]]'s *Two Treatises of Government* established core liberal principles:

**Natural Rights**
- **Life, liberty, property**: inalienable rights existing before government

[[John Stuart Mill]]'s *On Liberty* refined liberal theory:

**Harm Principle**
