# Virtue Ethics

**Author**: [[individuals/aristotle|Aristotle]]

**Year**: -350

**Historical Period**: [[periods/ancient-philosophy|Ancient Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Ethics, #Moral Philosophy

## Description

The ethical theory that moral evaluation focuses primarily on character traits (virtues and vices) rather than actions or consequences. A virtue is an excellent character trait that enables human flourishing (eudaimonia), developed through habituation and practical wisdom.

## Influenced By

- **builds_upon**: [[individuals/plato|Plato]]'s cardinal virtues and connection between virtue and knowledge
- **builds_upon**: [[individuals/socrates|Socrates]]' focus on virtue as the most important human concern
- **influenced_by**: Greek concept of *arete* (excellence) and *eudaimonia* (human flourishing)

## Influences

- **influences**: Medieval virtue theory through [[individuals/thomas-aquinas|Aquinas]]'s theological virtues
- **influences**: Contemporary virtue ethics revival through [[individuals/elizabeth-anscombe|Anscombe]], [[individuals/alasdair-macintyre|MacIntyre]], [[individuals/philippa-foot|Foot]]
- **influences**: [[individuals/confucius|Confucius]]'s [[ideas/ren|Ren]] and character-based ethics
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/deontological-ethics|Deontological Ethics]] for lack of universal moral rules
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/consequentialism|Consequentialism]] for ignoring outcomes of actions

## Notes

**Aristotelian Foundations:**

**Nicomachean Ethics:**
- Virtue (*arete*) as excellence of character
- **Moral virtues**: Courage, temperance, justice, generosity, etc.
- **Intellectual virtues**: Practical wisdom (*phronesis*), theoretical wisdom (*sophia*)
- **Function Argument**: Humans have essential function; virtue enables its fulfillment

**Doctrine of the Mean:**
- Virtue as mean between extremes of excess and deficiency
- Courage = mean between cowardice (deficiency) and rashness (excess)
- Generosity = mean between stinginess and profligacy
- Context-dependent: Mean varies by person and situation

**Practical Wisdom (*Phronesis*):**
- Intellectual virtue enabling moral virtue
- Ability to deliberate well about human affairs
- Perceives moral salience in particular situations
- Unifies particular virtues into coherent character

**Habituation:**
- Virtues acquired through repeated practice, not teaching
- "We become what we repeatedly do"
- Moral education through modeling and practice
- Character formation begins in childhood

**Contemporary Revival:**

**Anscombe's "Modern Moral Philosophy" (1958):**
- Critique of duty-based ethics without religious foundation
- Return to virtue concepts more promising than rule-following
- "Ought" concepts need grounding in human nature
- Virtue ethics as alternative to dominant utilitarian/Kantian approaches

**MacIntyre's After Virtue (1981):**
- Modern moral discourse incoherent fragment of older tradition
- Virtues make sense within social practices and traditions
- Narrative unity necessary for virtue
- Critique of liberal individualism's erosion of virtue

**Foot's Natural Goodness (2001):**
- Virtues as natural facts about human flourishing
- Moral evaluation similar to biological evaluation
- Humans as social species with characteristic needs
- Virtue as what promotes both individual and species flourishing

**Types of Contemporary Virtue Ethics:**

**Neo-Aristotelian:**
- Return to Aristotelian framework updated for contemporary concerns
- Emphasis on human nature and natural flourishing
- Examples: Foot, Hursthouse, Russell

**Pluralistic:**
- Multiple traditions of virtue (Christian, Buddhist, etc.)
- Cultural and historical variation in virtue concepts
- Examples: MacIntyre's tradition-constituted inquiry

**Driver Theory:**
- Virtues defined by their tendency to produce good consequences
- Reduces virtue to consequentialist foundation
- Virtue as reliable disposition to act beneficially

**Arguments For Virtue Ethics:**

1. **Moral Psychology**: Better captures how moral agents actually think and develop
2. **Motivational**: Focus on character provides intrinsic motivation for moral action
3. **Holistic**: Addresses whole person rather than isolated acts
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Can accommodate variation in moral practices
5. **Action Guidance**: Practical wisdom provides context-sensitive guidance

**Arguments Against Virtue Ethics:**

1. **Action Guidance Problem**: Doesn't provide clear rules for moral decisions
2. **Cultural Relativism**: Different cultures emphasize different virtues
3. **Vague Standards**: What counts as virtuous varies by interpretation
4. **Moral Luck**: Character depends partly on factors beyond agent's control
5. **Modern Context**: Ancient virtues may be outdated for contemporary life

**Contemporary Applications:**

**Medical Ethics**: Virtues of physicians (compassion, integrity, competence)
**Business Ethics**: Corporate virtues and character-based leadership
**Environmental Ethics**: Virtues appropriate to ecological relationships
**Political Philosophy**: Civic virtues necessary for democratic participation
