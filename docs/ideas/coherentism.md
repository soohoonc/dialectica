# Coherentism

**Authors**: Various (Neurath, Quine, Davidson, BonJour)

**Year**: 1900-present

**Historical Period**: [[periods/contemporary-philosophy|Contemporary Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Epistemology, #Justification

## Description

The epistemological theory that beliefs are justified by their coherence with other beliefs rather than by foundational basic beliefs. Knowledge forms a holistic web where beliefs gain support through their systematic interconnections and mutual consistency.

## Influenced By

- **responds_to**: [[ideas/foundationalism|Foundationalism]]'s problems with basic beliefs and the given
- **builds_upon**: [[individuals/w-v-o-quine|Quine]]'s holistic critique of analytic/synthetic distinction
- **influenced_by**: [[individuals/wilfrid-sellars|Sellars]]'s attack on the "myth of the given"
- **builds_upon**: Pragmatist emphasis on holistic webs of belief

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/donald-davidson|Davidson]]'s principle of charity in interpretation
- **influences**: Contemporary contextualism and epistemic holism
- **influences**: Philosophy of science through theory choice and confirmation holism
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/foundationalism|Foundationalism]] for lack of stopping point in regress
- **influences**: Virtue epistemology focusing on epistemic virtues rather than structure

## Notes

**The Coherentist Picture:**

**Web of Belief:**
- Beliefs form interconnected network without foundational base
- Justification emerges from systematic coherence, not linear derivation
- Central beliefs more entrenched, peripheral beliefs more revisable
- No sharp distinction between observational and theoretical beliefs

**Coherence Relations:**
- **Logical Consistency**: Beliefs don't contradict each other
- **Mutual Support**: Beliefs provide reasons for each other
- **Explanatory Connections**: Beliefs fit into unified explanatory scheme
- **Probabilistic Coherence**: Beliefs assign coherent probability distributions

**The Epistemic Regress Problem Revisited:**
- Foundationalism: Linear chains require foundational stopping point
- Coherentism: Circular justification acceptable if circle wide enough
- Web structure makes regress non-vicious
- Mutual support rather than asymmetric grounding

**Versions of Coherentism:**

**Negative Coherentism (Neurath/Quine):**
- No foundations, only holistic constraints
- Beliefs justified by fitting into overall theory
- Observation provides causal input, not epistemic foundation
- "Web of belief" metaphor - revise where pressure is least

**Positive Coherentism (BonJour):**
- Coherence as positive source of justification
- Coherent system more likely to be true than incoherent
- Observation beliefs gain justification through coherence
- Requires background claim that coherence indicates truth

**Arguments For Coherentism:**

1. **Myth of the Given**: No beliefs immune from revision or interpretation
2. **Theory-Ladenness**: Observation involves theoretical commitment
3. **Holistic Confirmation**: Theories tested as wholes, not individually
4. **Interpretation**: Understanding others requires holistic coherence
5. **Scientific Practice**: Theory choice involves coherence considerations

**Arguments Against Coherentism:**

1. **Alternative Coherent Systems**: Multiple incompatible but internally coherent belief sets
2. **Input Problem**: How does world constrain belief if no foundational input?
3. **Isolation Objection**: Coherent fantasy world might be completely false
4. **Stopping Point**: Still need some non-arbitrary termination of regress
5. **Vicious Circularity**: Circular justification remains problematic

**Responses to Objections:**

**Davidson's Solution:**
- Principle of charity: Interpret others as mostly rational and correct
- Coherence with perception provides world-constraint
- Holistic interpretation makes massive error impossible
- Truth and coherence necessarily connected through interpretation

**Explanatory Coherence:**
- Beliefs gain support by participating in best explanations
- Explanatory virtues: simplicity, scope, fruitfulness
- Scientific theories exemplify explanatory coherence
- Perception explained by, rather than foundational for, theory

**Contemporary Developments:**

**Contextualism:**
- Justification standards vary with context
- Coherence requirements change across epistemic contexts
- Combines coherentist insights with pragmatic considerations

**Virtue Epistemology:**
- Focus on intellectual virtues rather than belief structure
- Coherence as manifestation of intellectual virtues
- Social aspects of epistemic evaluation

**Computational Approaches:**
- Coherence as constraint satisfaction
- Network models of belief revision
- Artificial intelligence implementations of coherentist principles
