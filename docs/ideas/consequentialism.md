# Consequentialism

**Author**: [[individuals/jeremy-bentham|Bentham]]

**Year**: 1789

**Historical Period**: [[periods/enlightenment|Enlightenment]]

**Tags**: #Ethics, #Moral Philosophy

## Description

The ethical theory that the rightness or wrongness of actions is determined solely by their consequences or outcomes. The morally right action is the one that produces the best overall results, typically understood in terms of maximizing good and minimizing harm.

## Influenced By

- **builds_upon**: Empiricist psychology and hedonistic theories of human motivation
- **influenced_by**: [[individuals/david-hume|Hume]]'s naturalistic approach to ethics and critique of rationalist morality
- **responds_to**: Natural law theories and religious command ethics
- **builds_upon**: Scientific Revolution's emphasis on empirical evaluation and measurement

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/john-stuart-mill|Mill]]'s qualitative hedonism and [[ideas/utilitarianism|Utilitarianism]]
- **influences**: Contemporary welfare economics and cost-benefit analysis
- **influences**: [[individuals/peter-singer|Singer]]'s effective altruism and practical ethics
- **influences**: Modern decision theory and rational choice theory
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/deontological-ethics|Deontological Ethics]] for ignoring intrinsic rightness/wrongness
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/virtue-ethics|Virtue Ethics]] for neglecting character and motivation

## Notes

**Classical Utilitarianism:**

**Bentham's Hedonistic Calculus:**
- Pleasure and pain as fundamental motivators
- "Greatest happiness for greatest number"
- Quantitative hedonism: All pleasures equal in quality
- Felicific calculus: Intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity, fecundity, purity, extent

**Mill's Qualitative Refinement:**
- Higher and lower pleasures: "Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than fool satisfied"
- Competent judges prefer intellectual/aesthetic pleasures
- Quality matters, not just quantity of pleasure
- Harm principle: Actions wrong insofar as they harm others

**Sidgwick's Philosophical Framework:**
- Three methods of ethics: Egoism, Utilitarianism, Intuitionism
- Utilitarian principle as self-evident rational truth
- Problem of reconciling individual and universal good
- Systematic philosophical foundation for consequentialism

**Contemporary Developments:**

**Act vs Rule Consequentialism:**

**Act Consequentialism:**
- Each action evaluated by its particular consequences
- Context-sensitive moral evaluation
- Potentially demanding: Always do whatever produces best outcomes

**Rule Consequentialism:**
- Follow rules that generally produce best consequences
- Addresses problems of demandingness and coordination
- Rules as useful heuristics for consequentialist reasoning

**Types of Consequentialism:**

**Hedonistic:** Maximize pleasure, minimize pain
**Preference Utilitarian:** Satisfy preferences/desires
**Objective List:** Promote objective goods (knowledge, friendship, achievement)
**Welfarist:** Maximize overall well-being however understood

**Contemporary Challenges:**

**Demandingness Objection:**
- Consequentialism requires enormous sacrifices for optimal outcomes
- Must give to charity until marginal utility equals that of recipients
- Leaves no room for special relationships, personal projects
- Response: Satisficing consequentialism, virtue consequentialism

**Distribution Problem:**
- Focus on total/average utility ignores distributive justice
- Large population with lower average utility vs small with higher
- Utility monster: Being that gets enormous utility from resources
- Response: Prioritarian approaches, egalitarian constraints

**Knowledge Problem:**
- Cannot calculate all consequences of actions
- Uncertainty about future outcomes
- Unintended consequences often outweigh intended
- Response: Expected utility theory, rule consequentialism

**Moral Alienation:**
- Calculating consequences seems to miss point of morality
- Cannot be spontaneous friend/parent if always calculating
- Self-defeating to think about maximizing utility
- Response: Two-level theory, virtue consequentialism

**Arguments For Consequentialism:**

1. **Intuitive Appeal**: Outcomes matter morally - good consequences make actions better
2. **Practical Guidance**: Clear decision procedure for moral choices
3. **Universality**: Equal consideration for all affected beings
4. **Scientific Approach**: Empirical evaluation of moral theories
5. **Social Reform**: Provides basis for criticism of existing institutions

**Arguments Against Consequentialism:**

1. **Rights Violations**: May require violating individual rights for greater good
2. **Justice Problems**: Can justify punishment of innocents if consequences good
3. **Moral Intuitions**: Conflicts with firm moral convictions about absolute wrongs
4. **Special Obligations**: Ignores special duties to family, friends, compatriots
5. **Character**: Focuses on outcomes rather than moral character of agents

**Contemporary Applications:**

**Effective Altruism:**
- Use evidence and rational analysis to maximize good done
- Focus on most cost-effective interventions (global health, poverty, existential risk)
- Earning to give: Make money to donate rather than direct service
- Long-termism: Focus on consequences for future generations

**Public Policy:**
- Cost-benefit analysis in government decision-making
- Health economics: QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years)
- Environmental policy: Weighing costs against benefits
- Criminal justice: Deterrent effects vs retributive justice

**Medical Ethics:**
- Triage decisions: Greatest good for greatest number
- Resource allocation in healthcare systems
- End-of-life care: Quality vs quantity of life
- Public health measures vs individual autonomy
