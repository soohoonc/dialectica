# Being vs Becoming

**Authors**: [[individuals/parmenides|Parmenides]] vs [[individuals/heraclitus|Heraclitus]]

**Year**: -500

**Historical Period**: [[periods/pre-socratic-philosophy|Pre-Socratic Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Metaphysics, #Ontology

## Description

The fundamental debate in early Greek philosophy between Parmenides' doctrine of unchanging Being and Heraclitus' doctrine of universal flux or Becoming. This established the central tension between permanence and change in Western metaphysics.

## Influenced By

- **builds_upon**: Early Greek cosmology and the search for the *arche* (first principle) of reality
- **responds_to**: Mythological explanations of natural phenomena through rational inquiry

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/plato|Plato]] in [[ideas/theory-of-forms|Theory of Forms]] - Plato synthesized both positions with eternal Forms and changing material world
- **influences**: [[individuals/aristotle|Aristotle]]'s substance theory - Aristotle distinguished between substance and accidents to reconcile being and becoming
- **influences**: [[ideas/hegelian-dialectic|Hegelian Dialectic]] by [[individuals/georg-wilhelm-friedrich-hegel|Hegel]] - Hegel made contradiction and change central to reality
- **influences**: [[individuals/friedrich-nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s critique of Being - Nietzsche championed Heraclitean becoming against Platonic being
- **influences**: [[ideas/dasein|Dasein]] by [[individuals/martin-heidegger|Heidegger]] - Heidegger reinterpreted Being as temporal and historical
- **influences**: Modern process philosophy by [[individuals/alfred-north-whitehead|Whitehead]] - Reality as composed of processes rather than substances

## Notes

**Parmenides** (*On Nature*, c. 475 BCE) argued:
- Being is one, eternal, unchanging, and indivisible
- Change is impossible because it would require non-being to exist
- Sensory experience of change is illusion; reason reveals truth
- "What is, is; what is not, is not" - the principle of non-contradiction

**Heraclitus** (fragments, c. 500 BCE) argued:
- "All things flow" (*panta rhei*) - reality is constant change
- Unity emerges from opposition - "the path up and down are one and the same"
- The *Logos* (rational principle) governs cosmic change
- "You cannot step into the same river twice"

This debate established enduring philosophical problems:
- How can we have knowledge of a changing world?
- What makes identity possible through time?
- Is reality fundamentally stable or dynamic?

Plato's genius was recognizing both positions contained truth: the world of Forms provides Parmenidean permanence, while the material world exhibits Heraclitean flux. Contemporary physics echoes this tension between conservation laws (being) and evolutionary processes (becoming).
