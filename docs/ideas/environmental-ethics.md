# Environmental Ethics

## Core Concept
Environmental ethics examines the moral relationship between humans and the non-human natural world, challenging anthropocentric assumptions and developing frameworks for understanding our duties to nature, future generations, and non-human life.

## Historical Development

### Pre-Environmental Movement Foundations

**Transcendentalist Precursors**
- [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s *Walden* - simple living and direct nature experience
- [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s nature philosophy - spiritual and ethical significance of natural world
- Early American conservation movement - [[John Muir]] and wilderness preservation

### Foundational Period (1970s)

**Aldo Leopold's Land Ethic**
[[Aldo Leopold]]'s *A Sand County Almanac* (1949) provided foundational concepts:
- **"A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community"**
- **Biotic community**: extension of moral consideration to ecosystems
- **Land pyramid**: understanding ecological relationships and energy flows
- **Thinking like a mountain**: taking the long-term ecological perspective
- Challenge to anthropocentric land use practices

**Foundational Philosophical Questions**
Leopold's work raised fundamental questions:
- What are the boundaries of moral consideration?
- Do non-human entities have intrinsic or only instrumental value?
- How do we resolve conflicts between individual organisms and ecosystem health?

### Academic Philosophical Development

**Arne Naess and Deep Ecology**
[[Arne Naess]] articulated the deep ecology movement (1973):
- **Shallow vs. Deep Ecology**: anthropocentric reform vs. biocentric transformation
- **Biospheric egalitarianism in principle**: equal intrinsic worth of all living beings
- **Self-realization**: expanding identification with the broader ecological self
- **Platform principles**: population reduction, lifestyle changes, policy transformation

**Deep Ecology Eight-Point Platform**
1. Intrinsic value of all life forms
2. Diversity of life forms as values in themselves
3. Humans have no right to reduce diversity except to satisfy vital needs
4. Human population should decrease
5. Current human interference excessive
6. Policy changes required
7. Quality of life rather than quantity
8. Obligation to implement necessary changes

## Major Theoretical Approaches

### Anthropocentric Approaches
**Shallow Ecology/Resource Conservation**
- Nature valuable only instrumentally for human benefit
- Focus on pollution control and resource management
- Reform existing economic and political systems
- Examples: [[Gifford Pinchot]]'s utilitarian conservation

**Extended Anthropocentrism**
- Inclusion of future generations and broader human interests
- [[Joel Feinberg]]'s analysis of rights and future generations
- Environmental protection for long-term human flourishing
- Climate ethics and intergenerational justice

### Biocentric Approaches
**Reverence for Life Tradition**
- [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s "reverence for life" ethic
- Equal intrinsic value of all living beings
- [[Paul Taylor]]'s biocentric egalitarianism
- Challenge to speciesism and human superiority

**Life-Centered Ethics**
- [[Kenneth Goodpaster]]'s criterion of life for moral consideration
- [[Gary Varner]]'s biocentric individualism
- Focus on individual living beings as bearers of intrinsic value

### Ecocentric Approaches
**Holistic Environmental Ethics**
- [[J. Baird Callicott]]'s interpretation and defense of Leopold's land ethic
- Ecosystem integrity as fundamental value
- Challenge to individualistic moral frameworks
- Integration with evolutionary biology and ecology

**Gaia Theory Influence**
- [[James Lovelock]]'s Gaia hypothesis
- Earth as self-regulating system
- Implications for environmental ethics and policy
- [[Mary Midgley]]'s philosophical development

## Contemporary Debates and Developments

### The Singer-Regan Animal Rights Challenge

**Peter Singer's Utilitarian Approach**
[[Peter Singer]]'s *Animal Liberation* (1975) challenged environmental ethics:
- **Principle of equal consideration**: interests of all sentient beings count equally
- **Speciesism**: unjustified discrimination based on species membership
- Conflict with holistic environmental approaches that might sacrifice individuals for ecosystem health
- Focus on sentience rather than life or ecological function

**Tom Regan's Rights-Based Approach**
[[Tom Regan]]'s rights view further challenged environmental holism:
- **Subjects-of-a-life**: beings with beliefs, desires, memory, and sense of future
- Individual rights cannot be overridden for aggregate benefits
- **Environmental fascism** critique of holistic ethics
- Tension between animal rights and environmental protection

**Resolution Attempts**
- [[Mary Midgley]]'s mixed community approach
- [[J. Baird Callicott]]'s biosocial evolution framework
- [[Clare Palmer]]'s contextual approach to wild animal suffering
- Recognition of multiple, sometimes conflicting, moral considerations

### Ecofeminism

**Connections Between Oppression**
[[Val Plumwood]], [[Karen Warren]], and others developed ecofeminist ethics:
- **Conceptual connections**: dualistic thinking oppresses both women and nature
- **Historical connections**: women associated with nature, both devalued
- **Symbolic connections**: feminization of nature, naturalization of women
- **Epistemological connections**: alternative ways of knowing and relating

**Critiques and Developments**
- Debate over whether women are "naturally" closer to nature
- [[Carolyn Merchant]]'s historical analysis of Scientific Revolution
- [[Vandana Shiva]]'s analysis of development and Third World women
- Integration with environmental justice concerns

### Environmental Justice and Social Ecology

**Environmental Racism and Classism**
- Recognition that environmental burdens disproportionately affect marginalized communities
- [[Robert Bullard]]'s documentation of environmental racism
- Integration of social justice with environmental protection
- Challenge to wilderness-focused environmentalism

**Murray Bookchin's Social Ecology**
[[Murray Bookchin]] developed comprehensive social ecological theory:
- **Hierarchy as root problem**: domination of humans leads to domination of nature
- **Dialectical naturalism**: humans as nature rendered self-conscious
- **Libertarian municipalism**: democratic ecological communities
- Integration of anarchist politics with ecological thinking

### Climate Ethics

**Intergenerational Justice**
- [[Samuel Scheffler]]'s work on future generations
- [[Derek Parfit]]'s non-identity problem for climate policy
- [[Stephen Gardiner]]'s perfect moral storm analysis
- Questions about duties to future people

**Global Justice Dimensions**
- Disproportionate impacts of climate change
- Historical responsibility vs. current capacity
- [[Henry Shue]]'s work on climate justice
- Rights-based vs. utilitarian approaches to mitigation and adaptation

### Non-Anthropocentric Value Theory

**Rolston III's Natural Value**
[[Holmes Rolston III]] developed comprehensive theory of environmental value:
- **Systemic values**: ecosystems create and support values
- **Intrinsic value in nature**: value independent of human valuers
- **Natural history as story of value creation**
- Integration with evolutionary biology and ecology

**Callicott's Biosocial Evolution**
[[J. Baird Callicott]] grounded environmental ethics in evolutionary biology:
- **Darwin's moral sentiments**: expanded through ecological knowledge
- **Biosocial evolution**: capacity for expanded moral consideration
- **Land ethic as extension**: not replacement of human ethics
- Response to charges of environmental fascism

## Contemporary Applications and Challenges

### Biodiversity Conservation
- **Species vs. ecosystems**: conflicting conservation priorities
- **Novel ecosystems**: ethics of managing human-altered environments
