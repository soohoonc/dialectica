## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/wilhelm-dilthey|Dilthey]]'s distinction between explanation (Erklären) and understanding (Verstehen)
- **influences**: [[individuals/martin-heidegger|Heidegger]]'s fundamental ontology and [[ideas/dasein|Dasein]]
- **influences**: [[individuals/hans-georg-gadamer|Gadamer]]'s philosophical hermeneutics and fusion of horizons
- **influences**: [[ideas/phenomenology|Phenomenology]] through interpretive dimension of consciousness
- **influences**: Contemporary philosophy of science through theory-ladenness and interpretation
- **influences**: Postmodern philosophy through [[individuals/jacques-derrida|Derrida]]'s [[ideas/deconstruction|Deconstruction]]

## Notes

**Classical Hermeneutics:**

**Schleiermacher's Foundations:**
- **Universal Hermeneutics**: Principles apply to all texts, not just sacred ones
- **Psychological Interpretation**: Understanding author's mental processes
- **Grammatical Interpretation**: Understanding linguistic and cultural context
- **Hermeneutical Circle**: Part/whole relationship in understanding

**Dilthey's Development:**
- **Geisteswissenschaften vs Naturwissenschaften**: Human sciences vs natural sciences
- **Verstehen vs Erklären**: Understanding vs causal explanation
- **Historical Consciousness**: Understanding as historical and contextual
- **Lived Experience**: Interpretation grounded in concrete life

**Philosophical Hermeneutics:**

**Heidegger's Ontological Turn:**
- Understanding as fundamental structure of Dasein
- **Fore-having, fore-sight, fore-conception**: Pre-understanding structures
- **Hermeneutical Circle**: Not vicious but ontologically necessary
- **Thrown Projection**: Understanding as historical and future-oriented

**Gadamer's Development:**
- **Fusion of Horizons**: Understanding bridges historical distances
- **Effective History**: Past continues to shape present understanding
- **Prejudice Rehabilitation**: Prejudgments as conditions of understanding, not obstacles
- **Play Model**: Understanding as dynamic interaction between interpreter and text

**Key Concepts:**

**Hermeneutical Circle:**
- Understanding whole requires understanding parts
- Understanding parts requires understanding whole
- Not logical fallacy but structure of understanding itself
- Interpretation begins with pre-understanding, refines through engagement

**Historicity:**
- All understanding historically situated
- Cannot step outside historical context for neutral view
- Historical distance productive, not obstacle to understanding
- Tradition as medium of understanding, not object

**Horizon:**
- Range of vision including everything visible from particular standpoint
- Historical horizon: beliefs, values, assumptions of historical period
- Fusion of horizons: Productive encounter between past and present perspectives
- Understanding expands horizons rather than reproducing original meaning

**Contemporary Developments:**

**Critical Hermeneutics:**
- [[individuals/jurgen-habermas|Habermas]]: Hermeneutics needs ideology critique
- Power relations affect interpretation
- Emancipatory potential of understanding distorted communication
- Ideal speech situation as regulative idea

**Radical Hermeneutics:**
- [[individuals/john-caputo|Caputo]]: Hermeneutics without foundations
- Interpretation "all the way down" - no final interpretation
- Deconstruction as radicalized hermeneutics
- Ethics of interpretation in face of otherness

**Postcolonial Hermeneutics:**
- Critical of Western interpretive traditions
- Multiple hermeneutical traditions (African, Asian, Indigenous)
- Power dynamics in cross-cultural interpretation
- Decolonizing hermeneutical methods

**Applications:**

**Legal Hermeneutics:**
- Constitutional interpretation
- Living constitution vs originalism debate
- Legal reasoning as interpretive practice

**Literary Theory:**
- Reader-response criticism
- Intentional fallacy debates
- Meaning as reader-text interaction

**Social Sciences:**
- Interpretive sociology and anthropology
- Ethnographic method and thick description
- Understanding social action vs explaining behavior

**Arguments For Hermeneutics:**
1. Captures distinctive nature of human understanding
2. Explains contextual and historical character of knowledge
3. Provides alternative to scientistic reductionism
4. Illuminates interpretive dimension of all knowledge
5. Bridges humanities and social sciences

**Arguments Against:**
1. Relativistic implications - truth becomes interpretation
2. Conservative bias - privileges tradition over critique
3. Vague methodology - no clear rules for good interpretation
4. Threatens objectivity in human sciences
5. Infinite regress of interpretations
