# Fallibilism

**Author**: [[individuals/charles-sanders-peirce|Peirce]]

**Year**: 1868

**Historical Period**: [[periods/american-pragmatism|American Pragmatism]]

**Tags**: #Epistemology, #Philosophy of Science

## Description

The epistemological doctrine that our knowledge claims might be false and are open to revision. No beliefs are immune from doubt and correction, including our most fundamental scientific theories, logical principles, and observational reports.

## Influenced By

- **responds_to**: Cartesian quest for absolute certainty and indubitable foundations
- **influenced_by**: Darwin's evolutionary theory showing even basic cognitive capacities as evolved and revisable
- **builds_upon**: Scientific method's self-corrective character
- **responds_to**: [[ideas/foundationalism|Foundationalism]]'s claim for incorrigible basic beliefs

## Influences

- **influences**: [[ideas/pragmatism|Pragmatism]] by treating truth as regulative ideal rather than achievable goal
- **influences**: [[individuals/karl-popper|Popper]]'s falsificationism and critical rationalism
- **influences**: [[individuals/w-v-o-quine|Quine]]'s web of belief and rejection of analytic truths
- **influences**: Contemporary philosophy of science and epistemic humility
- **criticized_by**: Those who argue some knowledge (logical truths, immediate experience) must be certain

## Notes

**Peirce's Fallibilism:**

**"Some Questions Concerning Certain Faculties Claimed for Man" (1868):**
- No knowledge by direct intuition - all knowledge inferential
- No power of introspection - self-knowledge also inferential  
- No power to think without signs - thought always mediated
- No conception of absolutely incognizable - reality as limit of inquiry

**Key Principles:**
1. **Universal Fallibility**: All beliefs potentially revisable
2. **No Incorrigible Foundations**: Even basic observational beliefs can be wrong
3. **Method Over Results**: Focus on self-corrective inquiry rather than final answers
4. **Truth as Regulative Ideal**: Truth as what inquiry would converge on "in the long run"

**Scientific Implications:**
- Scientific theories as working hypotheses, not final truth
- Experimental method as continuous testing and revision
- Community of inquiry rather than individual certainty
- Progress through error correction rather than accumulation of certainties

**Logical and Mathematical Knowledge:**

**Against Apriori Certainty:**
- Even logical principles revisable (quantum logic, paraconsistent logic)
- Mathematical axioms chosen based on fruitfulness, not certainty
- Gödel's incompleteness theorems show limits of formal systems
- Alternative geometries show even spatial intuitions revisable

**Contemporary Developments:**

**Quine's Naturalized Epistemology:**
- No statement immune from revision, including logic and mathematics
- Holistic web where central beliefs more protected but not immune
- Observation sentences at periphery, logic at center, but all revisable
- Naturalism: Epistemology continuous with empirical science

**Popper's Critical Rationalism:**
- Knowledge grows through bold conjectures and severe tests
- Falsifiability as criterion of scientific status
- Aim for truth but expect to be wrong
- Critical attitude more important than positive reasons

**Moderate vs Radical Fallibilism:**

**Moderate Fallibilism:**
- Most beliefs revisable but some (logical truths, immediate experience) certain
- Distinguish between fallible theoretical claims and certain observational base
- Maintain epistemic hierarchy with more and less secure beliefs

**Radical Fallibilism:**
- No beliefs whatsoever immune from revision
- Even reports of immediate experience involve interpretation
- No sharp observational/theoretical distinction
- Complete epistemic democracy - all beliefs on same level

**Arguments For Fallibilism:**

1. **History of Science**: Past confident claims often proved wrong
2. **Theoretical Underdetermination**: Evidence always compatible with multiple theories
3. **Observation Theory-Laden**: No pure observational language
4. **Logical Revision**: Alternative logics show even logic revisable
5. **Evolutionary Epistemology**: Cognitive capacities evolved, hence fallible

**Arguments Against:**

1. **Self-Refutation**: If all beliefs fallible, then fallibilism itself might be false
2. **Practical Impossibility**: Cannot function without some certainties
3. **Logical Foundations**: Some logical principles necessary for thought itself
4. **Immediate Experience**: Seemings and appearances incorrigible
5. **Regress Problem**: Need some stopping point in justification

**Responses to Self-Refutation:**
- Fallibilism applied to itself: Might be wrong about universal fallibility
- Not skepticism: Fallible beliefs can still be rational and well-supported
- Meta-level principle about method, not object-level claim about world
- Consistent with high confidence in well-tested beliefs

**Contemporary Applications:**
- Philosophy of science: Theory change and scientific revolutions
- Epistemology: Contextualist and virtue-theoretic approaches
- Ethics: Moral fallibilism and disagreement
- Religious epistemology: Faith and epistemic humility
