# Personal Identity

## Core Concept
Personal identity concerns what makes a person the same person over time, addressing questions about what constitutes the continuity of the self through physical and psychological changes from birth to death.

## Historical Development

### Ancient and Medieval Foundations

**Platonic Soul Theory**
[[Plato]]'s *Phaedo* argued for personal identity through immortal soul:
- **Soul as true self**: person identical with rational soul
- **Transmigration**: soul persists through different bodily incarnations
- **Recollection**: learning as remembering what soul knew previously
- **Body as prison**: temporary housing for eternal soul

**Aristotelian Critique**
[[Aristotle]] offered alternative hylomorphic account:
- **Soul as form of body**: soul and body as unified substance
- **No separate existence**: soul cannot exist apart from body
- **Personal mortality**: individual person dies with body
- **Species immortality**: form continues in species, not individual

**Christian Development**
Medieval thinkers adapted classical theories:
- **[[Augustine]]**: rational soul bearing God's image
- **[[Thomas Aquinas]]**: soul as substantial form naturally immortal
- **Resurrection**: reunification of soul with glorified body
- **Beatific vision**: soul's fulfillment in divine contemplation

### Modern Philosophical Debates

**John Locke's Memory Theory**
[[John Locke]]'s *Essay Concerning Human Understanding* revolutionized personal identity theory:

**Consciousness and Memory**
- **Person vs. man vs. substance**: distinguishing different concepts
- **Consciousness**: awareness of past experiences as one's own
- **Memory continuity**: remembering past experiences constitutes personal identity
- **Day-man/night-man**: same human being but different persons if no memory connection

**Key Insights**
- **Psychological approach**: identity through mental rather than physical continuity
- **First-person perspective**: emphasis on subjective experience of identity
- **Forensic concept**: identity matters for moral and legal responsibility
- **Relativity**: identity relative to person-stages, not absolute metaphysical fact

**Problems with Memory Theory**
- **Forgotten experiences**: are forgotten events not part of personal history?
- **False memories**: do false memories create false identity?
- **Circular reasoning**: memory presupposes identity it's supposed to explain
- **Transitivity**: if A remembers B and B remembers C, does A = C?

**David Hume's Bundle Theory**
[[David Hume]]'s *Treatise of Human Nature* offered skeptical analysis:

**No Substantial Self**
- **Bundle of perceptions**: self as collection of mental states
- **No impression of self**: cannot find self in introspection
- **Habit and imagination**: mind creates fictitious identity through association
- **Theater metaphor**: consciousness as stage where perceptions appear

**Problems and Retreats**
- **Binding problem**: what unifies different perceptions?
- **Appendix concerns**: Hume's later doubts about his position
- **Practical necessity**: need for identity concept in ordinary life
- **Memory and imagination**: cannot distinguish real from imagined past

### German Idealist Developments

**Immanuel Kant's Transcendental Unity**
[[Kant]]'s *Critique of Pure Reason* offered transcendental approach:
- **Transcendental unity of apperception**: necessary condition for experience
- **Synthetic a priori**: \"I think\" accompanies all representations
- **Phenomenal vs. noumenal**: empirical self vs. transcendental subject
- **Moral personality**: practical reason and moral responsibility

**G.W.F. Hegel's Historical Self**
[[Hegel]]'s *Phenomenology of Spirit* presented developmental account:
- **Self-consciousness**: recognition through struggle with others
- **Master-slave dialectic**: identity through social relationships
- **Historical development**: self emerges through cultural evolution
- **Absolute spirit**: individual identity within universal development

## Contemporary Philosophical Theories

### Psychological Continuity Theory

**Modern Development**
Building on Locke, contemporary philosophers refined psychological approaches:
- **Sydney Shoemaker**: first-person authority and self-knowledge
- **[[Derek Parfit]]**: critique of personal identity's importance
- **Psychological connectedness**: direct memory and personality links
- **Psychological continuity**: overlapping chains of psychological connections

**Neo-Lockean Theories**
- **H.P. Grice**: memory and personal identity
- **Sydney Shoemaker**: quasi-memory and identity
- **John Perry**: personal identity and self-knowledge
- **Marya Schechtman**: narrative self-constitution view

### Physical Continuity Theory

**Biological Approach**

- **Split-brain cases**: divided consciousness and personal identity
- **Brain transplant thought experiments**: intuitions about physical vs. psychological identity
- **Gradual replacement**: Ship of Theseus problem for neurons

### Narrative Identity Theory

**Alasdair MacIntyre's Influence**
[[Alasdair MacIntyre]]'s *After Virtue* emphasized narrative structure:
- **Human life as quest**: identity through story-like structure
- **Social roles**: identity through participation in practices
- **Moral tradition**: individual identity within historical community
- **Unity of life**: narrative coherence across temporal development

**Contemporary Narrative Theorists**
- **Marya Schechtman**: creating identity through life narratives
- **Alasdair MacIntyre**: unity of human life as narrative quest
- **Charles Taylor**: strong evaluation and qualitative distinctions
- **Paul Ricoeur**: narrative and temporal structure of identity

**Narrative Self-Constitution**
- **Autobiographical reasoning**: constructing coherent life story
- **Identity claims**: narratives creating rather than discovering identity
- **Social construction**: stories shaped by cultural narratives
- **Multiple narratives**: different stories for different contexts

### Social Identity Theory

**Recognition Theory**
Influenced by [[Hegel]], contemporary theorists emphasize social dimensions:
- **[[Charles Taylor]]'s politics of recognition**: identity through others' recognition
- **[[Axel Honneth]]'s struggle for recognition**: three forms of recognition
- **Intersubjective constitution**: identity through social interaction
- **Misrecognition**: how negative recognition damages identity

**Feminist Perspectives**
- **Relational autonomy**: identity through caring relationships
- **Standpoint theory**: identity shaped by social position
- **Intersectionality**: multiple, overlapping identity categories

## Major Philosophical Problems

### Persistence Through Time

**Ship of Theseus Problem**
Applied to personal identity:
- **Gradual replacement**: brain cells gradually replaced
- **Branching cases**: what if original and replacement both exist?
- **Closest continuer**: identity goes to most similar successor
- **Multiple realizability**: same person in different physical substrates

**Temporal Parts vs. Endurance**
- **Four-dimensionalism**: persons as extended in time like space
- **Temporal parts**: person-stages related by psychological continuity
- **Three-dimensionalism**: whole person exists at each time
- **Change and persistence**: how things change while remaining same

### Fission Cases

**Derek Parfit's Thought Experiments**
[[Derek Parfit]]'s *Reasons and Persons* used science fiction cases:
- **Brain hemisphere transplant**: each hemisphere transplanted to different body
- **Teleportation**: destroying original and creating exact copy elsewhere
- **What matters**: survival vs. what matters in survival
- **Reductionism**: persons exist but not in ultimate sense

**Implications**
- **Determinate answers**: no fact of matter about identity in puzzling cases
- **What matters**: psychological continuity more important than strict identity
- **Future bias**: rational to care more about future than past selves
- **Moral implications**: reduced importance of personal identity for ethics

### Unity of Consciousness

**Binding Problem**
- **Phenomenal unity**: unified conscious experience from distributed brain processes
- **Access unity**: different mental contents available to same cognitive processes

- **Two streams**: left and right hemisphere processing independently
- **One person or two**: philosophical implications of divided consciousness
- **Integration**: how unified consciousness normally emerges from brain activity

### Memory and Quasi-Memory

**Circularity Problem**
- **Memory presupposes identity**: remembering requires prior identity with rememberer
- **[[Sydney Shoemaker]]'s quasi-memory**: memory-like states not presupposing identity
- **Causal connection**: right kind of causal connection between experience and memory
- **First-person authority**: special access to own mental states

## Contemporary Significance
Personal identity remains central to philosophy, ethics, law, psychology, and neuroscience. Questions about what makes someone the same person over time have practical implications for medical decision-making, criminal justice, social policy, and personal relationships. Contemporary developments in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and digital technology create new contexts for traditional questions while raising novel issues about enhancement, digital identity, and posthuman futures. The intersection of empirical research and philosophical analysis continues to deepen understanding of how identity develops, persists, and sometimes fails, with implications for human dignity, moral responsibility, and social recognition.
