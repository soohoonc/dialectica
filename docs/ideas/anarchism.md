# Anarchism

## Core Concept
Anarchism advocates for the abolition of all forms of hierarchical authority and coercive power, seeking to organize society through voluntary cooperation, mutual aid, and direct action rather than state control.

## Historical Development

### Early Modern Precursors
- [[William Godwin]]'s *Political Justice* (1793) - first systematic anarchist work
- [[Max Stirner]]'s *The Ego and Its Own* (1845) - individualist anarchism
- Anti-authoritarian themes in [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s civil disobedience

### Classical Anarchism (19th Century)

**Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: Property is Theft**
[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], often considered the first self-proclaimed anarchist:

**Critique of Property**
- **\"Property is theft!\"**: private property in land and capital exploits workers
- **Distinction**: personal possessions (use) vs. private property (exploitation)
- **Occupancy and use**: legitimate basis for possession
- **Usufruct**: right to use but not to exclude others permanently

**Mutualism**
- **Workers' cooperatives**: producer associations owning their tools
- **Mutual credit**: interest-free banking based on labor value
- **Federalism**: voluntary association of autonomous communities
- **Reciprocity**: exchange based on equal value rather than profit

**Critique of Authority**
- **\"Anarchy is order\"**: voluntary organization more efficient than coercion
- **Government corruption**: power inevitably corrupts those who hold it
- **Self-management**: people best govern themselves
- **Direct action**: workers organizing themselves rather than seeking political representation

**Mikhail Bakunin: Revolutionary Collectivism**
[[Mikhail Bakunin]] developed revolutionary anarchist theory:

**Critique of Marx**
- **\"Political power and wealth are inseparable\"**: socialism through state leads to new ruling class
- **Dictatorship of the proletariat**: temporary authority becomes permanent
- **Intellectual aristocracy**: Marx's scientific socialism creates new elite
- **Statism vs. anarchism**: fundamental divide in socialist movement

**Revolutionary Strategy**
- **Propaganda of the deed**: exemplary actions inspire popular uprising
- **Secret societies**: revolutionary organizations preparing insurrection

**Peter Kropotkin: Mutual Aid and Communism**
[[Peter Kropotkin]] provided scientific foundation for anarchism:

**Mutual Aid Theory**
- **Evolution through cooperation**: mutual aid as factor in evolution
- **Critique of Social Darwinism**: competition not sole evolutionary force
- **Human sociability**: cooperation natural to humans
- **Scientific anarchism**: evolution supports anarchist principles

**Anarchist Communism**
- **\"From each according to ability, to each according to need\"**: communist distribution
- **Abolition of money**: gift economy and mutual aid
- **Voluntary association**: no compulsion in communist society
- **Decentralized production**: local self-sufficiency

**The Conquest of Bread**
- **Critique of capitalism**: wealth created collectively but appropriated privately

### Individualist Anarchism

**Max Stirner's Egoism**
[[Max Stirner]]'s radical individualism:
- **The Unique and Its Property**: individual ego as only reality

- **Union of egoists**: temporary associations for mutual advantage
- **Against all causes**: even anarchism if it constrains the individual

**American Individualist Anarchism**
- [[Josiah Warren]]'s time-based currency and individual sovereignty
- [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s four monopolies: land, money, tariffs, patents
