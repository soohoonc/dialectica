# Nominalism

**Author**: [[individuals/william-of-ockham|William of Ockham]]

**Year**: 1320

**Historical Period**: [[periods/medieval-philosophy|Medieval Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Metaphysics, #Logic

## Description

The philosophical position that universals (general concepts like "redness" or "humanity") are merely names or mental concepts with no independent reality. Only individual particular things exist; general terms are useful fictions for organizing thought and language.

## Influenced By

- **responds_to**: [[ideas/universals|Realism about Universals]] by [[individuals/duns-scotus|Scotus]] and earlier scholastics
- **builds_upon**: [[individuals/peter-abelard|Abelard]]'s conceptualism as middle position between realism and pure nominalism
- **responds_to**: Platonic and Aristotelian assumptions about universal natures

## Influences

- **influences**: Early modern empiricism, especially [[individuals/john-locke|Locke]] and [[individuals/david-hume|Hume]]
- **influences**: [[ideas/logical-positivism|Logical Positivism]] and emphasis on linguistic analysis
- **influences**: Contemporary debates about properties, relations, and natural kinds
- **influences**: [[individuals/w-v-o-quine|Quine]]'s ontological parsimony and rejection of abstract objects
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/universals|Realists]] who argue science requires objective natural kinds and properties

## Notes

**The Medieval Problem of Universals:**
Three main positions emerged regarding the ontological status of universals:
1. **Realism**: Universals exist independently of minds and particulars
2. **Conceptualism**: Universals exist as mental concepts but not in external reality
3. **Nominalism**: Universals are merely words (names) with no mind-independent reality

**Ockham's Nominalism:**
- Only individual substances and qualities exist in reality
- Universal terms are "signs" that naturally signify collections of similar individuals
- "Humanity" doesn't exist; only individual humans exist
- General concepts arise from mind's capacity to use particular mental acts to stand for multiple similar things

**Ockham's Razor**: "Entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity"
- Don't postulate universal natures when individual things suffice
- Simpler ontology with only particulars is preferable
- Razor cuts away unnecessary metaphysical commitments

**Arguments for Nominalism:**
1. **Ontological Economy**: Fewer types of entities = simpler metaphysics
2. **Causal Impotence**: Abstract universals cannot causally interact with physical world
3. **Location Problem**: Where do universals exist if they're in multiple places simultaneously?
4. **Linguistic Analysis**: Universal terms function perfectly well as mere names

**Arguments Against:**
1. **Natural Kinds**: Science discovers objective similarities requiring universal natures
2. **Laws of Nature**: Scientific laws seem to require universal properties and relations
3. **Predication**: How can we truly say "a is F" if F-ness doesn't exist?
4. **Mathematics**: Mathematical objects seem to require abstract universal existence

**Contemporary Developments:**
- Trope theory: Properties as particular property-instances
- Structural universals: Properties defined by causal/structural roles
- Natural kind essentialism: Species and elements have essential natures
- Deflationary approaches: Universal talk as merely useful shorthand

The nominalism-realism debate continues in contemporary metaphysics, philosophy of science, and logic, with implications for understanding natural laws, mathematical objects, and the nature of properties.
