# Materialism

**Authors**: Various (Democritus, Epicurus, Hobbes, Marx, contemporary physicalists)

**Year**: -400 to present

**Historical Periods**: [[periods/pre-socratic-philosophy|Pre-Socratic Philosophy]] to [[periods/contemporary-philosophy|Contemporary Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Metaphysics, #Philosophy of Mind

## Description

The metaphysical doctrine that reality consists entirely of matter and energy interacting according to physical laws. Mental phenomena, if they exist, are either identical to or emergent from material processes in the brain.

## Influenced By

- **builds_upon**: [[ideas/atomism|Atomism]] by [[individuals/democritus|Democritus]] - All reality composed of atoms moving in void
- **builds_upon**: [[individuals/epicurus|Epicurus]]'s naturalistic worldview eliminating supernatural entities
- **responds_to**: Religious and idealistic explanations of natural phenomena
- **builds_upon**: Scientific Revolution's mechanical philosophy

## Influences

- **influences**: [[individuals/thomas-hobbes|Hobbes]]'s mechanistic account of human nature and politics
- **influences**: [[individuals/karl-marx|Marx]]'s historical materialism and critique of idealism
- **influences**: [[individuals/ludwig-feuerbach|Feuerbach]]'s critique of religion as projection of human nature
- **influences**: Contemporary physicalism and eliminative materialism
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/panpsychism|Panpsychism]] and those arguing consciousness cannot be reduced to matter
- **criticized_by**: [[ideas/substance-monism|Substance Monism]] - Spinoza's dual-aspect approach

## Notes

**Historical Development:**

**Ancient Materialism:**
- Democritus: Reality = atoms + void + mechanical necessity
- Epicurus: Added atomic swerve for free will, materialist ethics
- Lucretius: "Nothing exists but atoms and space" (*De Rerum Natura*)

**Modern Materialism:**
- Hobbes: Humans as sophisticated machines, thought as brain motion
- La Mettrie: *Man a Machine* (1747) - no essential difference between humans and animals
- D'Holbach: *System of Nature* (1770) - comprehensive materialist worldview

**19th Century Developments:**
- Marx: "It is not consciousness that determines life, but life that determines consciousness"
- Engels: Dialectical materialism as scientific worldview
- Feuerbach: Religion as alienated human essence

**Contemporary Physicalism:**
- **Identity Theory**: Mental states identical to brain states
- **Functionalism**: Mental states defined by causal/functional roles
- **Eliminative Materialism**: Folk psychology false; no beliefs or desires exist
- **Non-reductive Physicalism**: Mental properties supervene on but aren't reducible to physical

**Arguments for Materialism:**
1. **Causal Closure**: Physics appears causally closed; no room for non-physical causation
2. **Neural Dependence**: Mental changes correlate with brain changes
3. **Evolutionary Continuity**: Mind evolved gradually; no sharp emergence
4. **Scientific Success**: Physical sciences extraordinarily successful
5. **Ontological Parsimony**: Don't multiply entities beyond necessity

**Arguments Against:**
1. **Hard Problem**: Subjective experience seems irreducible to physical processes
2. **Knowledge Argument**: Mary the color scientist learns new facts upon seeing color
3. **Zombies**: Conceivably possible beings physically identical but lacking consciousness
4. **Intentionality**: Mental states' "aboutness" difficult to naturalize
5. **Qualia**: Qualitative feel of experiences resists physical description

**Contemporary Varieties:**
- **Reductive**: Mental phenomena reduce to physical phenomena
- **Non-reductive**: Mental properties real but depend on physical
- **Eliminative**: Mental concepts will be eliminated by mature neuroscience
- **Emergent**: Mental properties emerge from but aren't reducible to physical complexity

The materialism debate continues as neuroscience advances while the hard problem of consciousness remains unsolved.
