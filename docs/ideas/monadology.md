# Monadology

**Author**: [[individuals/gottfried-leibniz|Leibniz]]

**Year**: 1714

**Historical Period**: [[periods/early-modern-philosophy|Early Modern Philosophy]]

**Tags**: #Metaphysics, #Ontology

## Description

The metaphysical system proposing that reality consists of simple, indivisible, immaterial substances called monads. Each monad is a unique perspective on the universe, and they do not interact but develop according to pre-established harmony.

## Influenced By

- **criticizes**: [[ideas/substance-monism|Substance Monism]] by [[individuals/spinoza|Spinoza]] - Leibniz argued that Spinoza's single substance eliminates genuine plurality and individuality
- **responds_to**: [[ideas/cogito-ergo-sum|Cogito Ergo Sum]] by [[individuals/descartes|Descartes]] - Accepted mind as fundamental but rejected extended substance
- **builds_upon**: [[ideas/atomism|Atomism]] by [[individuals/democritus|Democritus]] - Transformed physical atoms into metaphysical simple substances
- **influenced_by**: [[ideas/occasionalism|Occasionalism]] by [[individuals/nicolas-malebranche|Malebranche]] - Rejected occasionalism but adopted the idea of no inter-substance causation

## Influences

- **influences**: [[ideas/phenomenology|Phenomenology]] by [[individuals/edmund-husserl|Husserl]] - The monad's perspectival nature anticipates phenomenological intentionality
- **influences**: [[ideas/possible-worlds|Possible Worlds]] by modern logicians - Leibniz's concept of possible worlds became central to modal logic
- **criticized_by**: [[individuals/immanuel-kant|Kant]] in [[ideas/categorical-imperative|Critical Philosophy]] - Kant rejected noumenal monads as unknowable things-in-themselves
- **influences**: [[individuals/alfred-north-whitehead|Whitehead]] in [[ideas/panpsychism|Process Philosophy]] - Whitehead's actual entities draw on Leibnizian monads

## Notes

Leibniz's *Monadology* presents 90 propositions establishing his metaphysical system. Key principles include:

1. **Simplicity**: Monads are simple, having no parts
2. **Uniqueness**: No two monads are identical (Principle of Identity of Indiscernibles)
3. **Perception**: All monads have perception, though most are unconscious
4. **Pre-established Harmony**: Monads don't interact but are synchronized by God

The system resolves the mind-body problem by making everything mental in nature. Physical phenomena are "well-founded" appearances of underlying monadic activity. This anticipates later idealistic solutions while maintaining genuine plurality against Spinoza's monism.

Contemporary philosophers like [[individuals/david-chalmers|Chalmers]] find in Leibniz resources for panpsychist theories of consciousness, while logicians developed his possible worlds semantics into a powerful tool for modal reasoning.
