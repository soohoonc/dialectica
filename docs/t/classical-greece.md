# Classical Greece

The Classical period of ancient Greek history (500-323 BCE) represents the zenith of Greek civilization. This era witnessed remarkable developments in philosophy, art, architecture, literature, and political theory.

## Historical Context

The period begins with the Greek victory over Persia at Marathon (490 BCE) and the subsequent Persian Wars. It ends with the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, marking the transition to the Hellenistic period.

## Philosophical Achievement

Classical Greece produced the foundational figures of Western philosophy:

- **Socrates** (470-399 BCE): Pioneer of dialectical method
- [[plato]] (c. 428-348 BCE): Founder of the Academy, developer of the [[forms|Theory of Forms]]
- [[aristotle]] (384-322 BCE): Founder of the Lyceum, father of formal logic

These thinkers established [[virtue-ethics]] as the dominant ethical framework and laid the groundwork for metaphysics, epistemology, and political philosophy.

## Political Innovation

[[athens]] developed direct democracy during this period, allowing citizens to participate directly in political decision-making. This experiment in self-governance influenced political thought for millennia.

## Cultural Flourishing

The Classical period saw:
- The construction of the Parthenon
- The tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides
- The histories of Herodotus and Thucydides
- The medical advances of Hippocrates
