# The Enlightenment

The Enlightenment (c. 1685-1815) was an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. Also known as the Age of Reason, it emphasized reason, individualism, and skepticism of traditional authority.

## Core Ideas

The Enlightenment was characterized by:

- **Rationalism**: Confidence in human reason as the primary source of knowledge
- **Empiricism**: Emphasis on observation and experience in acquiring knowledge
- **Skepticism**: Questioning of traditional religious and political authority
- **Progress**: Belief in human improvement through knowledge and reform

## Key Figures

### Philosophy

- [[kant]]: Synthesized rationalist and empiricist traditions with his critical philosophy
- John Locke: Developed empiricist epistemology and liberal political theory
- David Hume: Advanced skeptical empiricism
- Voltaire: Champion of civil liberties and separation of church and state
- Jean-Jacques Rousseau: Social contract theory and educational reform

### Science

- Isaac Newton: Mathematical physics and natural philosophy
- Benjamin Franklin: Electricity and practical invention

## The Categorical Imperative

[[kant]]'s [[categorical-imperative]] emerged during this period as a central contribution to ethical theory, establishing [[deontology]] as an alternative to both [[virtue-ethics]] and emerging consequentialist theories.

## Legacy

The Enlightenment's emphasis on reason, individual rights, and scientific inquiry profoundly shaped:
- The American and French Revolutions
- Modern liberal democracy
- The scientific method
- Contemporary secular thought
