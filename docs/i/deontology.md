# Deontology

Deontology (from Greek *deon*, meaning "duty") is an ethical theory that judges the morality of actions based on their adherence to rules or duties, rather than their consequences. The most influential deontological theory is that of [[kant|Immanuel Kant]].

## Core Principles

### Duty-Based Morality

Deontological ethics holds that certain actions are intrinsically right or wrong, regardless of their outcomes. Lying, for example, is wrong even if it produces good consequences.

### The [[categorical-imperative]]

[[kant]]'s categorical imperative provides the foundation for determining moral duties. An action is morally permissible only if its underlying principle (maxim) could be universalized without contradiction.

### Moral Absolutism

Most deontological theories maintain that some actions are absolutely prohibited. Torture, for instance, might be considered wrong regardless of circumstances.

## Contrast with Other Frameworks

### vs. [[virtue-ethics]]

While [[virtue-ethics]] (as developed by [[aristotle]]) focuses on character and asks "What kind of person should I be?", deontology focuses on actions and asks "What is my duty?"

### vs. Consequentialism

Consequentialism judges actions by their results; deontology judges actions by their conformity to moral rules. A deontologist might say "Don't lie" is an absolute duty; a consequentialist would permit lying if it produces better outcomes.

## Contemporary Applications

Deontological thinking influences:

- **Human rights**: Rights as inviolable duties owed to persons
- **Medical ethics**: Duties of non-maleficence, informed consent
- **Legal theory**: Rights-based jurisprudence
- **Business ethics**: Stakeholder duties

## Criticisms

Critics argue deontology:
- Cannot resolve conflicts between duties
- Ignores the importance of consequences
- Fails to account for moral complexity
- Provides inadequate guidance in novel situations
