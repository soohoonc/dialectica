# The Categorical Imperative

The categorical imperative is the central philosophical concept in the deontological moral philosophy of [[kant|Immanuel Kant]]. Introduced in his *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals* (1785), it provides a rational foundation for moral obligations.

## The Concept

Unlike hypothetical imperatives (which are conditional: "If you want X, do Y"), the categorical imperative is unconditional. It commands actions as necessary in themselves, regardless of desired ends.

## Formulations

Kant offered several formulations of the categorical imperative:

### The Universal Law Formulation

> "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

Before acting, ask: Could everyone rationally act this way? If universalizing the action leads to contradiction or irrationality, it is impermissible.

### The Humanity Formulation

> "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end."

This formulation emphasizes human dignity and prohibits using people merely as instruments.

### The Kingdom of Ends Formulation

> "Act according to maxims of a universally legislating member of a merely possible kingdom of ends."

## Relation to [[deontology]]

The categorical imperative is the foundation of [[deontology|deontological ethics]], which judges actions by their conformity to moral rules rather than their consequences.

## Contrast with [[virtue-ethics]]

Where [[virtue-ethics]] asks "What kind of person should I be?", Kantian ethics asks "What is my duty?" [[aristotle]]'s focus on character and flourishing differs fundamentally from Kant's emphasis on rational duty and moral law.

## Legacy

The categorical imperative has profoundly influenced:
- Human rights theory
- Legal philosophy
- Bioethics
- Contemporary moral philosophy
