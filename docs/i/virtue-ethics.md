# Virtue Ethics

Virtue ethics is an ethical framework that emphasizes the role of character and virtue in moral philosophy. Developed primarily by [[aristotle]] in the Nicomachean Ethics, it focuses on what constitutes a good life (eudaimonia) rather than rules or consequences.

## Core Concepts

### Eudaimonia

Often translated as "happiness" or "flourishing," eudaimonia is the ultimate aim of human life according to virtue ethics. It is not a feeling but an activity—living well and doing well.

### Virtue (Arete)

Virtues are stable character traits that enable their possessor to flourish. [[aristotle]] distinguishes between:

- **Intellectual virtues**: Wisdom, understanding, prudence
- **Moral virtues**: Courage, temperance, justice, generosity

### The Doctrine of the Mean

Moral virtue is a mean between two extremes—excess and deficiency. Courage, for example, is the mean between recklessness (excess) and cowardice (deficiency).

## Contrast with Other Frameworks

Virtue ethics differs from:

- **[[deontology]]**: Which focuses on following moral rules and duties (as in [[kant]]'s [[categorical-imperative]])
- **Consequentialism**: Which judges actions by their outcomes

## Historical Development

Virtue ethics originated with [[plato]] and [[aristotle]] in [[classical-greece]], fell into relative obscurity during the modern period's focus on deontology and utilitarianism, but experienced a revival in the 20th century through philosophers like Elizabeth Anscombe, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Philippa Foot.

## Contemporary Virtue Ethics

Modern virtue ethicists have expanded the framework to address:
- Environmental ethics
- Business ethics
- Bioethics
- Political philosophy
