# Konigsberg

Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was a major city in East Prussia and the lifelong home of [[kant|Immanuel Kant]]. The city played an important role in the [[enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and German intellectual history.

## Kant's City

[[kant]] spent his entire life in Konigsberg, famously never traveling more than 100 kilometers from the city. His daily walks were so regular that citizens could set their clocks by them.

The University of Konigsberg (Albertina), where Kant studied and later taught, was a center of philosophical inquiry. It was here that Kant developed his critical philosophy, including:

- The [[categorical-imperative]]
- The synthesis of rationalism and empiricism
- [[deontology|Deontological ethics]]

## Historical Significance

Founded in 1255 by the Teutonic Knights, Konigsberg served as:
- Capital of the Duchy of Prussia
- Coronation site of the first King of Prussia (1701)
- Major center of Baltic trade
- Important academic and cultural hub

## The Seven Bridges Problem

Konigsberg is famous in mathematics for the Seven Bridges Problem, solved by Leonhard Euler in 1736. The problem—whether one could walk through the city crossing each of its seven bridges exactly once—led to the development of graph theory.

## Fate

After World War II, Konigsberg became part of the Soviet Union and was renamed Kaliningrad. Much of the historic German architecture was destroyed during the war and subsequent Soviet reconstruction.
