discussions of humanity

## Architecture

This is a fancy UI layer on top of a markdown/obsidian vault directory.
It is optimized to show the conversation of humanity.

We define 5 objects within the ontology.
- Figures: the who (the figure, the soul)
- Times: the when (the temporal dimension)
- Locations: the where (the spatial dimension)
- Ideas: the why (the reason)
- Objects: the what of the physical sense (matter)

Each of the objects (the ontologies) will have an associated page to explore each
f/ - figures, basically biographies of a figure, a scroll wheel of portraits
t/ - times, a timeline of a times and periods, a timeline page
l/ - locations, basically maps of a location, a map page
i/ - ideas, basically essays of an idea, a graph of ideas (will be clustered by its links to each other)
o/ - objects, basically descriptions of an object: a page of objects, a scroll wheel of objects

the hows will be wiki pages (under /p directory) it will contain articles that link to different ontologies and other pages)

I am inspired by wikipedia and gwern.net

the thematic colors are black and white, with bolded and dotted underlined for links (like gwern). 

the individual pages will be markdown files (under a configurable directory, /docs for now)
